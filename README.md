# Pharmacovigilance Signal Detection Agent

AI Agent for Early Detection of Drug Safety Signals in Healthcare

## 1. Problem Statement

Pharmacovigilance teams continuously monitor adverse event (AE) reports to identify potential drug safety risks.  
Manual analysis is slow, reactive, and struggles to detect early emerging patterns across millions of reports.

**Objective:**  
Build an AI-powered Pharmacovigilance Agent that:

- Analyzes adverse event reports
- Detects emerging safety signals  
- Clusters similar adverse events  
- Ranks risks by severity and frequency  
- Generates weekly safety signal summaries using Generative AI  

This system helps safety teams **act early and reduce patient risk**.
