ct w/o contrast ([**6-5**]): impression: 1. no acute cervical fracture or malalignment. 2. multilevel severe degenerative changes of the cervical spine as detailed above. cxr ([**6-5**]): findings: pa and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate a previously 5.8 x 3.6 cm left upper lobe lung mass, now measuring 8.7 x 6.5 cm with interval cavitation and a new air-fluid level, which presumably represents a cavitated bronchogenic carcinoma with necrotic contents. superimposed infection cannot be excluded. this lesion abuts the anterior left hilus. no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. the cardiac silhouette is normal in size. the mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. the aortic knob is partially calcified without dilatation. cxr ([**6-7**]): impression: ap chest compared to [**6-5**]: slight increase in the heart size and heterogeneous opacification at the lung bases could be due to dependent edema, but raises more concern for pneumonia. the large cavitated mass in the left upper lobe contains a fair amount of fluid. there is the possibility of internal aspiration. no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion is present. echo ([**6-6**]): there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. the left ventricular cavity size is normal. regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (lvef>55%). there is no ventricular septal defect. right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. the aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. there is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). trace aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is no mitral valve prolapse. mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is a very small pericardial effusion. there are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. brief hospital course: patient is a 79 year-old gentleman with history of melanoma, presumptive squamous cell lung cancer with cxray revealing enlargening cavitated bronchogenic carcinoma with necrotic contents, and known osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions in the t-spine most likely from metastases presenting with pain, malaise, and falls at home, transferred to icu for a. fib with rvr which resolved with amiodarone. # altered mental status/encephalopathy: pt's mental status reportedly worsened in the setting of having his fentanyl patch increased from 25mcg to 50 mcg. moreover, the patient was found to be hypercalcemic and hypotensive on presentation. all three factors likely resulted in his ams, with resolution after decrease of his fentanyl patch, treatment and resolution of his hypercalcemia, and discontinuation of his home blood pressure medications. the patient should refrain from having increased fentanyl patch doses. infectious work-up was negative. # atrial fibrillation: patient with no known history of atrial fibrillation, developed a. fib with rvr and rate related ekg changes. precipitant unclear, but possibly etiology includes chronic disease (pt with h/o htn), pulmonary disease (patient with known copd), irritation of left atria from left lung mass, and echo revealing mild lvh, mild mr and as, so patient is good substrate. patient with rate related ekg changes that went away with better rate control. no chest pain, no dyspnea. cardiac markers normal and tsh wnl. in er was started on diltiazem gtt but became hypotensive so was admitted to the micu and started on an amiodarone gtt with a loading dose. rates better controlled with this but bp still low so amio stopped on am of [**6-6**] and pt returned to nsr. echo with mild as and small pericardial effusion without tamponade (likely malignancy related). given the patient's goals of care and falls at home, anticoagulation was not pursued. the patient's care is focused on comfort. the patient may continue his aspirin 325 mg. # hypotension: patient initially admitted to the micu for hypotension (and afib with rvr) which seemed to have developed in the setting of starting a diltiazem drip. responded to ivf but reocurred later with amiodarone drip. given more fluids and bp fine although low once amio/dilt were stopped. did not require pressors during icu stay. the patient was transferred to the floor. his blood pressures were within normal limits throughout his stay off the multi-drug hypertension regimen he was on at home. the patient states he takes too many medications, does not want to take htn medications, and his blood pressures were persistently in the 100s-140 range. he states that he used to have sbps in the 200s and felt fine. he should not be treated for his hypertension unless he requests it, becomes symptomatic, or sbps>200. initiating medications for htn should be discussed with the patient. am cortisol level wnl. # pain: patient with increasing pain of his shoulders and neck, receiving increasing doses of fentanyl patches without adequate relief. pain possibly secondary to malignancy. no evidence of fracture on ct c-spine. started on standing tylenol and contact[**name (ni) **] pcps office who confirmed home fentanyl patch had recently been uptitrated to 50mcg/hr q72hrs. rn at pcps office said that patient had increasing issues with confusion and falls on this higher dose and they were concerned that it was too much narcotic for him. in micu pt placed on fentanyl patch at 25mcg/hr and given prn oxycodone for breakthrough. pain remained reasonably well controlled. given the patient's desire to avoid confusion and his 1 to higher doses of fentanyl beyond his current dose of 25 mcg/hr, the patient was placed on standing tylenol and a lidocaine patch. he should also be given ibuprofen 200-400 mg q4-6h prn for pain before being given oxycodone as his renal function tolerates. notably, the patient's focus is on having clear mentation over pain control, so care should be taken before administering the low dose opiates. #cavitary lung mass most likely from squamous cell carcinoma - pt with history of melanoma but the lung mass appears to be primary squamous cell lung carcinoma. the patient has past sputum cytology with highly atypical squamous cells suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma which in setting of appearence on imaging and hypercalcemia is most consistent with lung cancer. the diagnosis and stage are unknown because the patient refuses biopsy and further work-up. these have been clearly stated in his records here as well as via discussion with the patient and his family on this admission. palliative care engaged in open discussion with patient and confirmed his goals of care. the patient understands the potential for his course of disease to worsen. the patient requests to be dnr/dni with plans for no aggressive care and focus on comfort and quality of life. # hypercalcemia: patient with elevated calcium to 12.3 (corrected ca2+=13.1) and low phos. patient with known lytic and blastic lesions in thoracic spine. pt was given ns for this with improvement. a pth was appropriately low. the patient was given pamidronate 60 mg on [**6-7**] with improvement in calcium, 9.9 on discharge. pamidronate can be repeated as needed at least a week after initial dose. # acute kidney injury: creatinine increased to 1.9, up from most recent baseline of 1.2. likely hypovolemic secondary to poor po intake. creatinine improved with fluids. the patient was briefly diuresed for his lower extremity edema which resulted in a rise in his creatinine from 1.4 to 1.6. subsequent diuresis was held with improvement of his creatinine to 1.3 at discharge. the patient is very volume sensitive/preload dependent likely from his diastolic dysfunction from lvh and aortic stenosis. thus, if diuresis is initiated for his swelling, it should be done carefully and gingerly with close eye on renal function. # acute on chronic diastolic chf: patient with 2+ swelling of lower extremities. there is likely an element of decreased oncotic pressure as well given the patient's low albumin. patient's bnp was 6600 and echo revealed mild lvh, mr, and as, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. lvef was well preserved. the patient was tried on two doses of iv lasix with improvement in volume status but worsened renal function. the patient is likely quite preload dependent, and thus if diuresis is given, it should be gently. #hypertension, benign: patient with history of poorly controlled hypertension on six anti-hypertensives. no evidence of hypertension here. pt with excellent blood pressure control despite all medications being discontinued. patient states he previously had sbps in 200s without any symptoms and not on medications. he does not wish to take any htn meds and wants to keep his medical list simple. #copd: patient with 40 pack year smoking history and history of copd, but no dyspnea, no wheezing. continued on homoe spiriva #cva s/p r cea: continue aspirin and lipitor #code status: dnr/dni - emphasis on quality of life and limiting procedures. future hospitalizations should be discussed with patient. transitional: 1) the patient's priority is to maintain a clear mental status. as such, we have started ibuprofen in order to help with pain without using opiates, but the patient's renal function should be monitored carefully with nsaid use. 2) the patient also wants his pain well controlled, but is more concerned about maintaining a clear mental status 3) pamidraonte was given here on [**6-7**] for osteolysis of his spine from his malignancy. it can be retreated as needed as long as it is 7 days after previous dose 4) the patient states that he would like discussion before hospitalization in the future. he may not want to be hospitalized depending on the situation 5) the patient states he does not want to go home. he would feel more comfortable with people taking care of him. he currently lives alone. after rehab, there will need to be ongoing discussion with patient and family about where he should go, as he feels that he cannot take care of himself. he currently lives alone at home, with nurses that come just a few times a week. 6) notable labs on last check: hct 30.1, bun 29, cr 1.3. medications on admission: -

the patient's sodium was 144, potassium of 4, chloride of 109, bicarbonate of 24, blood urea nitrogen of 15, creatinine of 0.6, blood sugar of 84. alt was 95, ast was 76, amylase of 41, alkaline phosphatase of 59. creatine kinase of 2526, lipase of 6. lithium level was less than 0.2. toxicology screen was positive for barbiturates and opiates. a strychnine level was pending at the time of admission. radiology/imaging: a head ct showed no acute process. hospital course: in summary, the patient is a 51-year-old male who was admitted to the [**hospital1 188**] with what was felt to be an adverse reaction to fentanyl and benadryl administration. he was originally admitted to the medical intensive care unit for observation after he had received a lot of benzodiazepines as well as droperidol. in the medical intensive care unit, the patient was noted to have rising creatine kinases with a negative mb index and an elevated temperature. he was transferred out to the general medical floor on the second hospital day in stable condition with a decreased temperature, and no further abnormal movements. 1. neurology: a neurology consultation was obtained when the patient was first admitted given that he had fever and mental status changes. it was felt that the patient's abnormalities were most likely secondary to a medication reaction, as they promptly resolved after withdrawal of the offending agents. the question of a lumbar puncture was raised, but given the patient's lack of neurologic findings, lack of meningeal signs, and quick resolution of fever without antibiotics, no lumbar puncture was ever obtained. the question of possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome was considered given the patient's clinical presentation. however, the patient adamantly refused taking any neuroleptic medications. the patient's primary care physician was not aware of the patient taking any current neuroleptic medications as well. 2. psychiatry: as stated, the patient was exhibiting delusional behavior. he was preoccupied about formaldehyde insulation that was present in his subsidized apartment. he denied any auditory or visual hallucinations. he stated that he felt like he was depressed but denied any active suicidal ideation, but stated that he did think about hurting himself from time to time but could ""never do it."" he indicated that he had, in the past, been under the care of a psychiatrist. his primary care physician was [**name (ni) 653**] regarding his baseline mental status, and it was found that this has been a long-term issue for him, and that she has seen him three times in the past, and he has exhibited this same type of behavior at her office. in fact, he even brought a sample of powder which he said was the offending [**doctor last name 360**] into her office at one point. a psychiatry consultation was called to assess for the patient's safety to be discharged on the third hospital day. they felt the patient did seem paranoid and delusional but was not at risk of harm to himself or others and was safe to be discharged. they recommended outpatient psychiatric treatment if the patient would agree to it. i spoke to the patient's primary care physician, [**name10 (nameis) **] she stated that she would attempt to get the patient into a program given the findings above. 2. gastrointestinal: the patient also reported a history of hepatitis c that he stated was secondary to a blood transfusion that he received. hepatitis serologies and ultimately came back showing him to indeed be hepatitis c positive. in addition, serologies were consistent with past exposure to hepatitis b with hepatitis b surface antibody and hepatitis b core antibody both positive; but hepatitis b surface antigen negative. the patient's ast and alt were mildly elevated while admitted. he also described a history of a 40-pound to 50-pound weight loss over the past one to two years as well as anorexia and chronic nausea and vomiting. he did not have any stigmata of chronic liver disease on physical examination, however. given his weight loss and long-term history of hepatitis with elevated liver enzymes, there was concern for hepatoma. i spoke with the patient's primary care physician and informed her of the hepatitis serology results as well as the fact that his liver enzymes were elevated. she stated she would get the patient referred to gastroenterology. 3. infectious disease: as stated, the patient had a temperature at the time of admission after he had significant agitation and muscular rigidity secondary to his presumed drug reaction. he never had an elevated white blood cell count. he had been afebrile for more than 24 hours at the time of this discharge summary. there was concern for possible urinary tract infection, as a urine sample which had been sent while a foley was in place showed a significant amount of blood with white blood cells present. however, there were no bacteria seen, and there was a significant amount of red blood cells consistent with trauma from the foley. a repeat urinalysis was sent when the foley was removed, and this showed still blood present but no nitrites and no leukocyte esterase. there were no bacteria seen on microscopy. it was felt that his urine findings were most likely secondary to trauma from the foley and not infection. his cultures have remained negative. blood cultures have remained negative as well. stool cultures were negative for clostridium difficile, salmonella, and shigella. 4. renal: the patient did have a rise in his creatine kinase amount after having his initial episode of agitation and significant thrashing about with injury to his arms and legs when he was in the four-point restraints. his creatine kinases peaked at 8868 on the second hospital day, and on the third hospital day they were trending down. at the time of this discharge summary the most recent creatine kinase was 5569. there was another creatine kinase pending for this afternoon. if it is still trending down, the patient will be discontinued from his intravenous fluids. his renal function had remained stable with a stable blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. 5. communications: the patient's primary care physician [**last name (namepattern4) **]. [**first name4 (namepattern1) **] [**last name (namepattern1) 41646**] (at telephone number [**telephone/fax (1) 41647**]) was [**telephone/fax (1) 653**] throughout the [**hospital 228**] hospital stay and informed of the events which occurred. condition at discharge: condition on discharge was stable. medications on discharge: the patient was to be given a prescription for vicodin one to two tablets p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. for back pain. he was given a prescription for 10 pills. discharge followup: the patient was to follow up with his primary care physician, [**last name (namepattern4) **]. [**last name (stitle) 41646**], within one week following discharge. he will need further evaluation for pain control and possibly a chronic pain unit consultation to help manage his back pain. in addition, he will need follow up for his hepatitis c and elevated liver enzymes. he also needs psychiatric followup of his likely delusional disorder. discharge diagnoses: 1. choreoathetosis secondary to fentanyl/benadryl. 2. hepatitis c. 3. chronic low back pain. 4. delusional disorder.

mid-dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with abundant eosinophils (see note). note: no bacteria, fungi or acid fast bacilli are seen on brown-brenn, gms, [**last name (un) 18566**] and afb stains. immunostains for cmv, hsv1 and 2, and vzv are negative. no vasculitis or superficial pustulosis is seen. in the described clinical context, the findings are most suggestive of a systemic hypersensitivity reaction, as to a drug. clinical: specimen submitted: left abdomen. clinical: 76 yr. old male with sepsis and on many antibiotics for past 6 weeks with morbilliform rash. please evaluate for drug hypersensitivity, agep, dress, vasculitis, infectious, toxic erythema. gross: the specimen is received in a formalin filled container labeled with the patient's name ""[**known firstname **] [**initials (namepattern4) **] [**known lastname 52513**]"", medical record number and date of birth. specimen consists of a punch of skin measuring 4.4 cm in diameter excised to a depth

cassette a. brief hospital course: this is a 76 year old gentleman w/ a hitory of cardiomyopathy, af not on coumadin, recurrent nonhealing ulcers and recent osteomyelitis transferred from [**hospital3 **] with severe sepsis w/o definite source. active issues #. shock: the pt was transferred to [**hospital1 18**] micu in shock, likely due to combination -of septic and cardiogenic etiologies. he was treated empirically for sepsis with broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and meropenem for 7 days. weaned off all pressors on [**8-4**]. no source of infection was identified and antibiotics were discontinued on [**8-7**]. he was afebrile and hd stable at the time of transfer to medicine floor. the etiology of his sepsis was not identified. at the time of discharge, pt had been stable off of antibiotics and was afebrile without leukocytosis. # ischemic cardiomyopathy: ef 20-30% on echo ([**8-1**]). a nstemi prior to transfer to [**hospital1 18**] cannot be ruled out given slightly elevated ckmb and troponin. lisinopril, and spironolactone were held. asa and plavix were continued. his statin was restarted. he was given iv lasix for volume overload and responded well to doses of 120 iv. he was put on metoprolol 12.5 mg [**hospital1 **]. his lisinopril and spironolactone were still on hold at the time of discharge because of unstable kidney function. on telemetry, there has been frequent asymptomatic pvc and nsvt. # [**last name (un) **]/ckd: patient developed acute renal failure and required cvvh while in the micu in the setting of hypotension and shock likely related to atn. renal was consulted, his urine sedimentation showed granular casts without muddy brown casts. he was not hyperkalemic, acidotic or uremic. at the time of transfer to medicine floor he did not need further cvvh though he was oligouric making 300cc or urine on the day prior to transfer. in the setting of low free water intake he became hypernatremic with a free water deficit. the hypernatremia and uop improved with diuresis and d5w resuscitation. his creatinine was stable around 2 at time of discharge. # respiratory failure: he was intubated for inadequate compensation for metabolic acidosis/concomitant respiratory acidosis. he was extubated on [**8-5**]. upon transfer to [**hospital1 **] he was breathing well on 3l o2. on the medical floor, he occasionally required 2l nc to maintain his o2 saturation above 90%. he had one night of desaturation into the 70s when sleeping which required transfer to the micu. this was most likely secondary to chronic air trapping with obesity hypoventilation and pulmonary edema as his lasix had been held in the setting of increased diarrhea from cdiff. his oxygenation improved with diuresis and cpap, and he was transferred back to the floor. sleep medicine evaluated the patient who recommended bipap 10/5 when sleeping. # upper extremity non-occlusive thrombi: reported history of cns bleed, according to the pcp, [**name10 (nameis) **] had a spontaneous intracranial hemorrheage. anticoagulation was held given history of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. upper extremity us showed multiple ij thrombi and a thrombus at the picc site. picc was d/ced, left arm swelling decreased. vascular was consulted about possible svc filter but recommended against placement at this time. he is scheduled for outpatient vascular follow up. # c. diff: patient was noted to have diarrhea on [**8-15**]. cdiff was positive. he was started on po vancomycin. he remained afebrile without leukocytosis and his diarrhea improved. he was discharged with plans to complete a 14 day course of po vancomycin (last day [**2172-8-29**]). # pusutular drug reaction: the pt developed a body rash at osh, although exact cause of the reaction was unclear. review of discharge medications from life care [**location (un) 3320**] was unrevealing as there were no new medications at the time of discharge. however, it is unclear which meds were given while he was at rehabilitation. he completed a course of clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment with marked improvement. per dermatology, this is consistent with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (agep), a drug reaction, although unclear which medication at the rehab was the culprit. if recurs, will need to follow lft and eos. rash had resolved by discharge. new erythematous blanching rash on abdomen and thighs started on [**8-18**], is stable and likely from irritation. this will need to be monitored at rehab. #. atrial fibrilation with rvr: cardiology was consulted and recommended rate control with metoprolol and continued diuresis. he was maintained on telemetry. he was not anticoagulated for afib as he had hx of spontaneous intracranial bleeding. # osteomyelitis: pt has a history of unhealing ulcers secondary to pvd. amputation was suggested, but declined by the patient in the past. he developed osteomyelitis about 2 months prior to admission, and treated with 6 wk course of vanco/zosyn for right non-healing ulcer. imaging [**7-29**] at osh showed slight worsening vs prior. at [**hospital1 18**], on [**7-31**], plain film of the right foot was concerning for osteomyeltiis involving right #5 metatarsal. esr and crp on [**2172-8-8**] unremarkable. podiatry did a biopsy through the wound, cultures were negative (on antibiotics). podiatry ecommended local wound care, wet to dry dressings, off-loading multipodus boots. weight bearing status: pwbat to right heel. he will need to follow up with podiatry after discharge. # ischemic toes: the pt was noted to have necrotic toes concerning of ischemia in setting of coming off pressors. his non invasive aterial study on [**8-7**] showed monophasic dp on r and triphasic pedal pulses on l. vascular surgery was consulted and felt that observation with follow up as an outpatient was appropriate. # agitation/ams: this occured while pt was on the floor and differential included hypoglycemia vs hypernatremia vs ongoing occult infection. his nighttime insulin dose was decreased. hypernatremia was treated with d5w. respiratory distress also a factor which improved during the day with stimulation and family members. # swollen painful scrotum: concerning for fournier's gangerene, urology consulted and found no evidence of fournier's on u/s or ct. he responded to repositioning. this was likely due to edema from fluid overload. # dm: on glargine and insulin sliding scale. # communication: wife [**name (ni) **] [**telephone/fax (2) 52514**]c

condition: mental status: confused - sometimes. level of consciousness: alert and interactive. activity status: bedbound. discharge instructions: dear mr. [**known lastname 52513**], it was a pleasure taking care of you at the [**hospital1 771**]. you were transferred from an outside hosiptal with sepsis, which is a serious illness that happens when an infection affects the whole body so your heart had trouble to supply your organs. after aggressive medical management including strong antibiotics, blood pressure medications, respiratory support, cardiovascular support, you were able to recover from the serious illness. the source of your infection was not identified despite our best effort in multiple radiology scans, and labs tests. however, due to your serious condition, a number of your organs have been affected. your kidney was damaged for lack of blood supply. fortunately, it has improved and you did not require dialysis. your toes turned blue because of lack of blood supply. secondly, you came in with a diffuse body rash that we thought was caused by a drug reaction. the drug that might have caused your rash was never identified. your rash improved with a steroid cream. also, in the search of your infection source we found multiple clots in your upper arms where the iv lines previously were placed. you did not have occlusion of your arm vessels. we did not give you blood thinning medications given your adverse reaction to coumadin in the past. you also had an infection of your bowel with a bacteria called clostridium difficile which causes diarrhea. it was treated with oral vancomycin which you will continue until [**2172-8-29**]. you also had trouble breathing which required a transfer to the medical icu for one night. you were placed on cpap breathing machine and given more lasix which improved your symptoms and you were able to come back to the medical floor. you also received intravenous medication to remove fluids from your body. we were able to make some progress. however it appears that this process will take some time. we think that you may benefit from further diuresis in a rehab setting, where more targeted nursing and physical therapy could also be provided. please note that a number of changes have been made to your medications. please follow up with your providers as scheduled. you will need to be seen by cardiology and vascular surgery providers. you should also follow up in the sleep clinic to help manage your sleep apnea. followup instructions: department: vascular surgery when: tuesday [**2172-9-1**] at 10:30 am with: [**first name11 (name pattern1) **] [**last name (namepattern4) 1244**], md [**telephone/fax (1) 1237**] building: lm [**hospital unit name **] [**location (un) **] campus: west best parking: [**hospital ward name **] garage we are working on a follow up appointment for your hospitalization in pulmonary sleep medicine. it is recommended you be seen within 1 month of discharge. the office will contact you with the appointment information. if you have not heard within a few business days please call the office at [**telephone/fax (1) 612**]. department: cardiac services when: tuesday [**2172-9-1**] at 2:00 pm with: [**name6 (md) **] [**last name (namepattern4) 6738**], md [**telephone/fax (1) 62**] building: sc [**hospital ward name 23**] clinical ctr [**location (un) **] campus: east best parking: [**hospital ward name 23**] garage completed by:[**2172-8-23**]",1

consulted endocrinology for recommendations for blood sugar control while admitted. a pre-op chest x-ray also revealed a large substernal thyroid mass causing tracheal deviation. endocrinology also evaluated her for this process and recommended outpatient biopsy with likely removal by thoracic surgery. she was continued on methimazole and tfts monitored throughout her hospitalization. endocrinology has recommended that she follow up with her outpatient endocrinologists in [**1-25**] weeks after discharge with a repeat of her thyroid function tests (tfts). left lower extremity wounds: she had left groin wound dehiscence and large amounts of serous drainage postoperatively. on [**12-20**], she was taken to the operating room for left groin wound debridement, sartorius flap, and vac placement. her vac was changed every three days while in the hospital. her left and right foot ulcers were debrided and treated with santyl ointment which should continue at discharge. at the time of discharge she was stable. her inr was 1.7 and she was continued on coumadin 5mg qhs. the vac was removed from her left groin wound and it was packed with wet to dry dressing. the vac should be

change in the ability to move or use your leg or the ability to feel your leg ?????? temperature greater than 100.5f for 24 hours ?????? bleeding, new or increased drainage from incision or white, yellow or green drainage from incisions open wound: vac dressing patient's discharge instructions introduction: this will provide helpful information in caring for your wound. if you have any questions or concerns please talk with your doctor or nurse. you have an open wound, as opposed to a closed (sutured or stapled) wound. the skin over the wound is left open so the deep tissues may heal before the skin is allowed to heal. premature closure or healing of the skin can result in infection. your wound was left open to allow new tissue growth within the wound itself. the wound is covered with a vac dressing. this will be changed around every three days. the vac helps keep the wound tissue clean, absorbs drainage, prevents premature healing of skin, and promotes appropriate healing. when to call the doctor: watch for the following signs and symptoms and notify your doctor if these occur: temperature over 101.5 f or chills foul-smelling drainage or fluid from the wound increased redness or swelling of the wound or skin around it increasing tenderness or pain in or around the wound followup instructions: your vascular surgery followup appointment: provider: [**name10

[**5-1**] ct torso impression: 1. no bowel obstruction is identified. small bowel and large bowel loops appear unremarkable. 2. bilateral increased interstitial markings and septal thickening is suggestive of presence of the heart failure. the heart is also mildly enlarged. 3. small bilateral pleural effusions and dependent atelectatic changes are noted at both lung bases. infiltrate/infection cannot be ruled out. small pericardial effusion is also noted. 4. a 4-mm nodule is noted within the anterior portion of the right middle lobe. pathologically enlarged right paratracheal node measures 13 mm in the short axis. 5. diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis. 6. the aorta demonstrates severe stenosis below the renal arteries. no aneurysmal dilatation is noted. 7. small right kidney with normal sized left kidney. no hydronephrosis or stones are identified. . [**5-1**] ct head 1. no acute intracranial abnormality. 2. chronic infarcts in the right cerebellum and centrum semiovale. 3. sinus disease involving left maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. . [**5-2**] eeg impression: this is an abnormal eeg due to the presence of probable periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges (i.e., pleds) involving the right hemisphere which could indicate a subcortical abnormality involving this area. the presence of a diffusely slow background and disorganized background is consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy of toxic, anoxic, or metabolic etiology. the occasional sharp waves can be a sign of cortical irritability, but clinical correlation would need to be provided. no evidence for ongoing seizures is seen. . [**5-19**] echo/bubble study: focused study to assess for patent foramen ovale. images were obtained at rest, with cough and post-valsalva release with injection of agitated saline. no evidence for an atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale was identified. there is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function. no pericardial effusion is seen. .

[**6-15**] echo bubble: saline contrast study performed to assess for intracardiac shunt. no passage of agitated saline is seen into the left heart is identified. the left ventricular cavity is normal in size. there appears to be global hypokinesis that is more pronounced/worse that the study of [**2167-5-19**]. . [**6-19**] echo: the left atrium is elongated. the right atrium is moderately dilated. the estimated right atrial pressure is [**4-16**] mmhg. left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. there is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (lvef = 30 %). systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved. no masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. the right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild globalfree wall hypokinesis. the aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-4-30**], global left ventricular systolic function is more depressed and the right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated and hypokinetic. the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher. . [**6-22**] ct of the chest without iv contrast: there is no axillary lymphadenopathy. there is pretracheal lymphadenopathy measuring up to 1.5 cm. this is unchanged. there are small bilateral effusions. these are stable. again noted is an ovoid nodule in the apex of the right lung measuring 1.2 x 0.5 cm. this is stable in appearance. there are tiny nodules in the right lung. these are again stable. there is diffuse septal thickening which is unchanged. in the presence of cardiomegaly this is consistent with chf. ct of the abdomen without iv contrast: the liver is without focal lesions. the gallbladder has been removed. spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands are unremarkable. the right kidney is atrophic. the left kidney has some bulging of the contour at mid pole measuring about 1.6 cm. this is difficult to evaluate on the prior study as there is significant artifact from the patient's body touching the gantry but is likely present. there is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. small and large bowel are normal. ct of the pelvis without iv contrast: the uterus is normal in size and contains some calcified fibroids. there is diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. there is no adjacent inflammatory fat stranding. there is no free fluid in the pelvis. no pelvic adenopathy is noted. on bone windows, there are degenerative changes involving the lumbar spine. impression: 1. no findings to explain the patient's symptoms. the examination is essentially unchanged in comparison to prior studies. 2. interstitial prominence and small bilateral pleural effusions with cardiomegaly are consistent with chf. again this is stable. 3. mediastinal adenopathy unchanged. . [**6-23**] ruq us:1. no focal fluid collections. 2. atrophic right kidney consistent with chronic renal failure. .

negative hepatitis b surface antibody positive hepatitis b virus core antibody negative hepatitis c serology hepatitis c virus antibody positive brief hospital course: discharge summary (as of [**2167-5-27**]) assessment and plan: this is a 53 year old woman with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, copd, pulmonary hypertension, s/p l aka who is oxygen dependent on nasal canula 4 liters at home, and polysubstance abuse who presented to [**hospital3 35813**] center in [**state 792**]with altered mental status, hypoxia, and agitation. she was intubated for airway protection and transferred to [**hospital1 18**]. course complicated by anuric renal failure requiring dialysis. . 1)mental status change: most likely multifactorial, as patient with previous polysubstance abuse. chronic small vessel disease noted on head ct. eeg negative for seizure activity. per family, patient lives alone and able to care for herself and perform activities of daily living. on admission, toxicology screen revealed opiates and tricyclics, and by medical notes on transfer, patient had been using more sedating medications than normal. neurology evaluated patient and vitamin b12 and folate levels were normal. she received thiamine. tsh level was elevated to 8 and her t4 was only very slightly below normal. thus, thyroid function was not attributed to altered mental status. an eeg revealed encephalopathy, but no seizures. ct head revealed chronic small vessel disease. lp and mri were deferred. -upon extubation, patient slowly became more alert, first with purposeful eye tracking and then by following simple commands. she received haldol and ativan, which sedated her profoundly for several days. then, after extubation, she began to have conversations but with frequent outbursts with cursing at times, poor attention and short term memory. she became febrile on [**2167-5-7**], which was concerning for a line infection, and was treated initially with vanco/zosyn changed to vanco/meropenem plan for 3 day course complete [**2167-5-9**]. c. diff negative x3. her head ct was unchanged. on [**5-13**], patient had her picc line and tunneled hd line placed and developed fevers within 12 hours. only one blood culture from [**5-14**] revealed one bottle of staph coagulase negative organisms. treated with ten day course of vancomycin (per hd protocol) through [**5-23**]. -lexapro was restarted on [**2167-5-12**], but held on [**5-22**]. psychiatry continued to follow patient and for continued outbursts recommended haldol 0.5mg po/iv three times daily. as above, concern that heavy sedatives with ativan and haldol cause profound sedation. she required soft wrist restraints for prevention of line removal. pt was transferred to the micu on [**6-2**] for respiratory compromise (see below). -upon arriving at the floor on [**6-5**] the patient was aox3, but with residual confusion, impulse control issues, and aggitation. her course was complicated by recurrent episodes of aggitation and anxiety which were hard to control. she perseverated on her medications, her course, and her dietary restrictions. psych was consulted and attempted to help control these outbursts without using benzodiazepems. she often complained of dyspnea, but requested ativan as treatment. she was transferred to the micu for low o2 saturation, where she was diuresed for congestive heart failure/volume overload. she was transferred back to the floor on [**6-15**], where she continued to be anxious and take off her o2 mask. psych recommended continuing standing haldol as well as 100mg neurontin qhs. benzodiazepines were avoided. this combination had a calming effect and the patient was significantly less agitated without being over-sedated, thought to be back to her baseline mental status. remained at baseline mental status for the rest of the hospitalization . 2) respiratory compromise: at outside hospital, patient was hypoxic to high 80's on 3l. at home, she requires 4l nasal canula. patient has history of copd, chf, and pulmonary hypertension per outside notes. intubated on transfer and thought that congestive heart failure contributed to hypoxemic event. no clear pneumonia. patient was aggressively diuresed via hemodialysis. she was extubated on [**5-7**]. hypoxia seems out of proportion to edema demonstrated on imaging. tte was negative for patent foramen ovale. . on [**2167-6-1**], the patient triggered for hypoxia 68% on 6 liters (the patient formerly had been 90-92% on 6 liters. on recheck, the o2 sat was 88% and then 90-91% on 6 liters without intervention. the patient was scheduled to have hd as scheduled on [**2167-6-2**]. . at hd, the hd catheter was noted to be nonfunctioning. tpa was tried without success. then, the patient was found to be hypoxic to 75% at hd with abg 7.53/26/44 0on a 40% venti mask. on a nrb, the patient's saturations improved to 97% and a repeat gas was 7/53/27/58. . the patient denied any chest pain and says the shortness of breath was not acute in onset but had been developing over the past few days. however, her sbp was noted to be 188-216 during hd and the patient was given her am bp meds as a result. cxr indicated volume overload and pt. was thought to have had acute pulmonary edema [**1-9**] hypertension and inability to dialyze. pt was transferred to micu and had temporary femoral hd line initially placed, then tunneled hd line placed by ir [**6-3**]. she had 7l removed during micu course with improvement of oxygenation and was sent back to floor [**6-5**]. . while on the floor she was maintained on 6l of nc. she did occasionally complain of dyspnea and anxiety, however it was hard to differentiate this from her psychiatric issues, as she was often breathing at a normal rate and sat'ing in the mid 90s while complaining. she generally maintained saturations from 88-95%. she did have at least two desat's into the low 80s at night, but responded within minutes to reassurance and haldol without changing any pulmonary medications or oxygen. on [**6-9**] she had an episode of somlenence and increased confusion after her haldol had been increased to 2mg/dose and her nc o2 dropped to 4l. she was somlenent but arousable, and still oriented to self she recovered mental status quickly after a 50% venti mask was placed, and was then seen by the micu staff. she was transferred again to the micu at that point, and again was diuresed aggressively with good result. repeat tte again showed no patent foramen ovale/shunt. cta was negative for pe. . she was transferred back to the floor on [**6-15**], where she continued to required 6-8 l o2 and occasionally desat'd in setting of anxiety. an echo [**6-19**] showed evidence of worsening chf (ef 30% now, was >55% in [**month (only) **]), which would explain continued increased oxygen requirement and sob, with evidence of pulmonary edema on cxr. in conjunction with the renal team, the patient required almost daily hd or ultrafiltration to draw off fluid. attempts were made with medications to balance the need for afterload reduction with supporting a blood pressure which could tolerate volume loss through dialysis. this primarily involved decreasing the patient's betablocker and verapamil dose significantly, while maintaining isosorbide nitrate. the patient was witnessed several times eating high salty foods, and being non-compliant with the fluid restriction which complicated attempts to manage her volume status. with aggressive hd, as well as improved management of her anxiety and aggitation (above) the patient gradually was weaned down to her baseline requirement of 4l o2 on nasal cannula. . 3) anuric renal failure: atn likely from tca/opiate overdose. outside hospital records revealed creatinine of 4.0 in [**month (only) 958**] [**2166**]. on admission, anuric. she was hyperkalemic, so initially received kayxelate, calcium gluconate, insulin, and bicarbonated. no ecg changes. renal ultrasound negative for obstruction. received aggressive hemodialysis sessions. there was concern that tunneled dialysis line infected, but as she was not rigoring and did not ever develop fever or hypotension except when on dialysis, believed that filter on hemodialysis machine may have caused adverse reaction. asaghi filter used on [**5-22**] with good effect. . management of the patient's volume status was complicated by dietary noncompliance and aggitation. after requiring 2 micu transfers from the floor due to decreased oxygen saturation from pulmonary edema, we were finally able to dialyze her sufficiently to bring her back to baseline oxygen requirement. we monitored her intake carefully and impressed upon her the importance of dietary compliance. adding neurontin to her anxiety regimen helped calm her and she became more compliant with our management strategy and was less likely to take off her oxygen support. renal recommends performing a 24 hour urine collection after one month to re-evaluate her renal status. . 4) cardiovascular: --ischemia: history of coronary artery disease. as outpatient, on aspirin but no beta blocker or ace-inhibitor. ecg without ischemic changes and initial cardiac enzymes negative. continued aspirin and added beta blocker. --pump: evidence of pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure on admission. as anuric, removed excess fluid with hemodialysis. --rhythm: remained in sinus rhythm. started on beta blockade. --hypertension: severely elevated blood pressures. started amlodipine, metoprolol, and isorbide. goal blood pressure <170, but due to longstanding hypertension, developed worsened mental status when blood pressures less than 140. most likely due to hypoperfusion. in setting of hypotensive episodes during dialysis, held antihypertensives on mornings of dialysis. over the course of hospitalization, we adjusted her bp medications according to what was tolerated

concern for infection or other etiology. [**6-18**] culture from hd catheter had no growtn. c. diff was negative. antibiotics were discontinued on [**6-23**] given no organism isolated and patient being afebrile. subsequent culture from [**6-24**] showed no growth to date. can consider other cause of leukocytosis: patient was not on systemic steroids so that is unlikely to be a cause. patient had mediastinal lymphadenopathy and lung nodules, which could suggest a malignant cause. recommend working up malignancy as outpatient given that patient is clinically stable and would benefit from rehab placement. . 7) depression: on outpatient lexapro. restarted during hospitalization, but discontinued, per psychiatry, on [**5-22**]. . 8) prophylaxis: patient on sc heparin (was on coumadin as outpatient, but unclear reason), lansoprazole, bowel regimen, and thiamine. . 9) access: picc placed on [**5-13**], but removed [**5-22**]. tunneled hemodialysis catheter placed on [**5-13**]. picc placed [**6-3**], removed [**6-21**]. . 10) fen: initially on tubefeeds. speech and swallow evaluation on [**5-18**] cleared patient for thin liquids and pureed solids. aspiration precautions. eventually advanced to regular renal diet. occasionally was hyponatremic, thought due to excess free water ingestion. was kept on fluid restriction 1l/day, with varying effect as patient would sometimes obtain water/fluids when the nurse was not looking. . 11) rash: patient noted to have morbilliform rash on trunk and flank on evening of [**5-25**]. most likely result of drug reaction. potentially vancomycin. started on hydrocortisone cream, sarna lotion, and triamcinolone cream. resolved. pt also noted to have intragluteal irritation with sattelite lesions, likely yeast infection. started on miconazole powder. . 12) code: full. confirmed with daughter.

[**known lastname **] is a 64 yo f w/ pmh of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation complicated by a left mca thromboembolic stroke without any residual deficits who was anticoagulated with pradaxa and presented to her pcps office with melena x 3days and found to have a duodenal diverticula with mass that appeared to be a gallstone. #upper gi bleed- patient presented with melena and hct drop from 45-->29.2 (from 2 years prior) and orthostatic. this was in the setting of being on pradaxa and had no known preciptants of nsaids, alcohol, or smoking. she was admitted to the icu for urgent egd and monitoring given her need for continued anticoagulation. egd showed no ulcers or gastritis and there was a divericula in the 2nd part of the duodenum with a green/black mass that appeared to be a gallstone and was biopsied. pathology showed a mixed-type calculus. she was transfused 1u prbc with inappropriate bump in hct and was monitored in the icu prior to being transfered to the floor. when patient was transferred to the floor, she had stable vital signs and hematocrit. she reported that her stools were non-bloody and looked brown. she underwent a repeat egd and a colonoscopy. the egd showed a single small angioectasia that was not bleeding in the duodenal bulb. a gold probe was applied for tissue destruction successfully. a single non-bleeding diverticulum with large opening was found in the second part of the duodenum. a small hiatal hernia was also seen. the colonoscopy showed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and distal descending colon. since no source of the gi bleeding was identified a capsule study was recommended, which the patient had the following day. she tolerated the capsule study without any problems. [**name (ni) **] hematocrit remained stable at around 27-29 throughout the rest of her hospitalization. on discharge, she felt well and denied any bloody stools or melena. she was discharged with a ppi. #paroxysmal afib- patient has been on pradaxa prior to admission. she has a history of paroxysmal afib with a subsequent stroke while on aspirin. her chads2 score is only a 2, however given it was for a stroke she requires lifelong anticoagulation. on admission, her pradaxa was discontinued and she was started on a heparin drip as a bridge after her egd was performed to reduce her risk of stroke. her pradaxa was discontinued in the meantime. based on discussions with her cardiologist, dr. [**last name (stitle) **], it was recommended to start coumadin and discontinue pradaxa. given her risk of bleeding, patient should be on an anticoagulant that can be closely monitored and reversed to prevent future gi bleed especially since the source of bleeding could not be identified by egd and colonoscopy. this was fully explained to ms. [**known lastname **]. there were several discussions with the patient regarding the risk of bleeding by restarting pradaxa and our recommendation of starting coumadin. however, patient's mother had an adverse reaction to coumadin and she refused to start coumadin, thinking that she will definitely have the same reaction. we attempted to reassure the patient several times that adverse side effects are rare and that she will be closely monitored while on coumadin, but she continued to refuse the medication. given her ugib in the setting of pradaxa and her continuous refusal to start coumadin, dr. [**last name (stitle) **] recommended restarting on pradaxa at a lower dose (from 150mg to 75mg [**hospital1 **]). the risk of a stroke at this lower dose was explained to the patient. she acknowledged full understanding of the risks of continuing with pradaxa (increased risk of bleeding if she returns to her previous dose and increased risk of stroke at the lower dose). she also acknowledged understanding of why we thought coumadin was a better choice -- a decreased risk of both bleeding and having a stroke while on the appropriate dose of coumadin. she believed that the potential adverse reaction of coumadin outweigh the benefits. therefore, she was discharged with 75mg pradaxa and bridged with lovenox. she will follow up with her cardiologist, dr.

[**2153-3-22**] ct abdomen/pelvis: impression: 1. mild perinephric stranding adjacent to the left kidney, most likely from recent percutaneous biopsy. a small hyperdense focus in the posterior aspect of the left kidney likely represents a tiny hematoma. 2. hyperdense blood within the left collecting system, including the proximal ureter, with no evidence of obstruction. there is a large amount of blood and clot within the bladder. there is no large hematoma outside of the collecting system. 3. massive abdominal ascites. 4. multiple irregular hypodensities within the liver, incompletely characterized on this non-contrast enhanced study, compatible with multifocal hcc, better seen on prior reference imaging studies. 5. mediastinal and porta hepatis lymphadenopathy. 6. colonic diverticulosis. [**2153-3-21**] kidney biopsy: ultrasound guidance for renal biopsy by nephrologist: ultrasound examination of the kidneys was performed. the lower pole of the left kidney was identified and the position was marked on the patient's back for renal biopsy to be performed by the nephrologist. [**2153-3-21**] cxr: opacification in infrahilar right lung is probably atelectasis, unchanged. there are no findings to suggest current pneumonia. heart size is normal. no pleural abnormality. right jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.

[**2153-3-27**] ct abdomen/pelvis: impression: 1. unchanged hyperdense focus in the posterior left kidney, consistent with a small subcapsular hematoma. 2. decreased amount of hyperdense blood and clot both within the proximal left collecting system and the bladder. no hematoma is seen outside of the collecting system. 3. large amount of abdominal ascites. 4. incompletely characterized irregular hypodensities within the liver consistent with the patient's known multifocal hcc. brief hospital course: 63-year-old male with hep c cirrhosis and hcc with new onset acute renal failure and transferred to the unit for gu bleed after left renal biopsy. # acute renal failure: cr was elevated on admission to 11.9 from baseline 0.9. renal was consulted and advised dialysis as well as a kidney biopsy. he received several sessions of bedside hemodialysis; two sessions were prematurely stopped as his blood pressure did not tolerate it. cr came down to 4.2 following dialysis and further trended down to 2.9 prior to discharge. his lasix was held given his acute renal failure and hypotension. his other antihypertensives, amlodipine and aldactone, were also held. renal ultrasound showed enlarged prostate and large amount of ascites but normal kidneys. initially, it was felt that his acute renal failure was secondary to sorafenib induced nephrotoxicity. however, the kidney biopsy light microscopy showed mesangial proliferative gn. immunofluorescence showed 2+ igg and 2+ lambda mesangial deposition. there were no thrombi in the microvasculature to make deifinite diagnosis of a tma to implicate the sorafenib. spep showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and upep showed no monoclonal ig and was negative for bence [**doctor last name 49**] proteins. the serum free light chain assay was pending on discharge. [**country 7018**] red was negative for amyloid. his [**doctor first name **] was also positive at 1:640, lupus anticoagulant was negative, and anti-cardiolipin igg/m were pending at discharge. preliminary biopsy results were suspicious for fibrillary glomerulonephritis. he was discharged with follow-up at nephrology clinic for further evaluation as outpatient. he was discharged on sevelamer for hyerphosphatemia. he was also restarted on his lasix as cr stabilized. # gu bleed s/p kidney biopsy: pt underwent kidney biopsy on [**2153-3-21**] that was complicated by gross hematuria. he was seen by urology and put on cbi. his hematuria led to drop in hct from high 20s to low 20s and a drop in blood pressure to systolic 70s. he was transferred to the icu for the hypotension. ct abdomen showed perinephric stranding adjacent to the left kidney, most likely from recent percutaneous biopsy, a small hematoma in left kidney, and blood in the collecting system and bladder. he required a total of 5 units prbcs and 1 bag platelets throughout hospital admission. hct was stable at baseline in high 20s by time of discharge. repeat ct abdomen showed that small hematoma in kidney was stable. he no longer had hematuria at discharge and was able to urinate without a foley. # ?transfusion reaction: of note, pt exhibited rigors during his first transfusion. he was not febrile. per transfusion medicine, this was likely not a febrile non-hemoltyic transfusion reaction given the short duration of his symptoms, no subsequent fever and that leukoreduction significantly decreases the risk of these reactions. he experienced no adverse reactions from his subsequent transfusions. # hypotension: bp at admission was systolic 80s. he was given iv fluids and his antihypertensives and diuretics were held (with the exception of nadolol). he later became hypotensive to systolic 70s following hematuria after a kidney biopsy and hemodialysis. pt also with mild hyperthermia to 95 concerning also for infection on admission. he was pan-cultured, with negative urine and blood cultures. patient started on ctx 2gm q24hrs x2 days for possible sbp, but was dicscontinued [**3-23**] as likelihood of sbp felt to be very small with no abdominal pain, normal wbc and no fevers. peritoneal fluid showed no signs of infection. following transfusion of prbcs and iv fluids, bp stabilized in systolic 100s-120s throughout remainder of admission. # le edema: pt presented with le edema, left worse than right. on admission he endorsed some calf pain as well. b/l lenis were obtained, which were negative for dvt. pain resolved and pt was able to ambulate without difficulty. he was discharged back on his lasix. # hepatocellular carcinoma: pt was s/p sorafenib [**2153-1-22**] to [**2153-3-6**]. he has recently transferred his onc care here. he was continued on nadolol at admission but this was briefly held in the icu when gi bleed was being ruled out for drop in hct. he underwent a therapeutic paracentesis on [**2153-3-26**]; peritoneal fluid was benign and 3l were removed from abdomen. he will discuss with his outpatient oncologist whether sorafenib can be restarted once kidney function stabilizes. medications on admission: 1. oxycodone 5mg po q4h prn 2. aldactone 100mg po daily 3. lasix 40mg po daily 4. nadolol 20mg daily 5. protonix 40mg daily 6. amlodipine/benzapril 10/40 7. nexavar (on hold) 8. levaquin 500mg po x 1 week discharge medications: 1. oxycodone 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po q4h (every 4 hours) as needed for pain. 2. furosemide 40 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 3. nadolol 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 4. protonix 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one (1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po once a day. 5. sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po tid w/meals (3 times a day with meals). disp:*90 tablet(s)* refills:*0* discharge disposition: home discharge diagnosis: primary: acute renal failure secondary: hepatocellular carcinoma discharge condition: mental status: clear and coherent. level of consciousness: alert and interactive. activity status: ambulatory - independent. discharge instructions: it was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital. you were admitted with acute kidney failure. the severity of your kidney failure required several sessions of hemodialysis. your kidney function improved with the hemodialysis. you were evaluated by our renal consult team who performed a kidney biopsy. this was complicated by bleeding that caused your blood counts to drop and your blood pressure to drop. you were transferred to the intensive care unit briefly because of this and were transfused with blood products. your blood pressure recovered and the bleeding in the urine stopped. your kidney biopsy showed a rare condition called fibrillary glomerulonephritis. it is very important that you have regular follow-ups at the [**hospital 10701**] clinic for frequent monitoring of your kidney function and possibly further testing. the following medications were changed: 1) stop amlodipine/benzapril unless one of your outpatient doctors wants to restart. your blood pressure was extremely good in the hospital so you didn't need it on discharge. 2) stop aldactone. ask your outpatient doctors when [**name5 (ptitle) **] [**name5 (ptitle) **] restart this medication. 3) stop levaquin 4) stop nexavar 5) start sevelemar 800mg three times a day with meals to lower your phosphorous levels followup instructions: you have the following appointments scheduled for you. you will need to come to the [**hospital 2793**] clinic on the [**location (un) 448**] of the [**hospital ward name 121**] building ([**hospital ward name **]) on monday [**2153-4-2**] to get your labs drawn. please come between the hours of 9am and 2pm and bring with you the lab order slip. department: hematology/oncology when: friday [**2153-4-6**] at 3:30 pm with: [**last name (lf) 3150**],[**name8 (md) **] md [**telephone/fax (1) 11133**] building: sc [**hospital ward name 23**] clinical ctr [**location (un) 24**] campus: east best parking: [**hospital ward name 23**] garage department: west [**hospital 2002**] clinic when: wednesday [**2153-4-4**] at 2:30 pm with: [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**last name (namepattern1) **] [**name8 (md) **], md [**telephone/fax (1) 721**] building: de [**hospital1 **] building ([**hospital ward name 121**] complex) [**location (un) **] campus: west best parking: [**street address(1) 592**] garage completed by:[**2153-3-29**]",0

brain abscess: pt initialy given vancomycin/ceftriaxone/flagyl for broad coverage and on [**2119-5-31**], the pt unerwent burr hole and aspiration without complication. pt given dilantin and keppra for seizure prophylaxis initialy. brain abscess grew out strep anginosus. pt had thorough workup to investigate etiology: panorex of teeth, tte, tee and ct a+p. ct a+p showed cecal thickening and typhlitis, possibly the original source of infection, although pt denied every having gi symptoms. after patient's initial post-op course, he developed daily fevers up to 103 ultimately attributed to antibiotic drug reaction. see below for antibiotic course. after a trial of several antibiotics, it was felt that he had a beta-lactam allergy and he was ultimately switched to vancomycin and flagyl which he ultimately tolerated well. pt had repeat head imaging (head ct [**6-16**], head mri [**2119-6-18**]) which demonstrated enlargement of the abscess. the patient was then taken for a second i&d ([**2119-6-21**]), via mini craniotomy. the patient tolerated this procedure well, and returned to the medicine floor that day. post-operative neurologic exam was within normal limits. of note, abscess cultures were negative (including fungi and anaerobes). repeat imaging on [**6-27**] with mri suggested possible extension of the abscess again. the patient underwent third i&d on [**2119-6-28**]. no pus or abscess was found during this procedure (washings were negative) and his prior mri findings were likely attributed to post-op changes rather then progressing abscess infection. pt remained neurologically intact. #surgical interventions for abscess the pt underwent mutiple i&ds for s. anginosus brain abscess: [**2119-5-31**], [**2119-6-21**], [**2119-6-28**]. pt is due to get staples removed early [**2119-7-9**] (10 days since most recent i+d). # pharmacologic treatment of abscess/red man syndrome/b-lactam allergy: the pt was treated with numerous antimicrobial agents. treatment course was complicated by drug-induced rashes and fevers. pt was placed on empiric antibiotic therapy with vanc/ceftriaxone/flagyl until speciation was determined. pt was then switched to penicillin g. due to rash, penicillin was discontinued and he was then switched to ceftriaxone/flagyl. patient's rash worsened and he had daily high fevers 103, and he was then switched to meropenem. rash temporarily abated, but returned worse than before (morbilliform from head to toe, also with fevers). meropenem was discontinued and pt was placed on vancomycin/flagyl. during his initial vancomycin infusion ([**2119-6-16**]), pt developed characteristic 'red man syndrome' with cehst pain, pruritis, redness, agitation during the infusion. the patient was transferred to the micu for further observation and his vancomycin infusion rate was slowed down. he was initialy given solumedrol during his vanco infusions and that was then stopped as his clinical picture and rash improved. he was maintained on vancomycin (slow infusion over 3 hrs) and flagyl for the remainder of his hospital course and tolerated this well. the patient was discharged on vancomycin and flagyl, four week course from the date of third i&d ([**7-1**]- [**2119-7-26**]). pt will continued to get weekly cbc with diff, bun, cr, vanco trough, and close follow up with id and neurosurgery. # vancomycin infusion reaction: during patient's vancomycin infusion ([**2119-6-16**]), the patient became acutely agitated, tachypneic, and complained of worsened pruritus and sudden-onset chest pain with redness throughout body. the patient was diagnosed with ""red man syndrome."" the patient was transferred to the micu for supervision of further infusions. infusion rate was slowed (over 3hours). he was initialy ""pre-treated"" with diphenhydramine and methylprednisolone prior to vanco infusion, to further reduce rash and pruritus. methylprednisolone was eventually discontinued and patient tolerated vancomycin slow infusions without difficulty. # transaminitis: the patient had intermittently elevated lfts. transaminitis was likely due to drug reaction (phenytoin vs beta-lactams). ruq u/s and abdominal ct demonstrated no abnormalities, and bilirubins were normal. lfts trended down and stabalized while on vancomycin and flagyl. # eosinophilia: the patient had a eosinophilia, coincident with rash and transaminitis. eosinophilia was attributed to drug allergy. work up was negative for helminth infection, etc. # seizure prophylaxis: the pt had an apparent seizure after his first i&d. he was placed on phenytoin and levacetiram for seizure prophylaxis. due to concerns that phenytoin was contributing to his rash, fevers, and transaminitis, phenytoin was discontinued later in the hospital course. the patient was maintained on levacetiram throughout. he will follow up with neurosurgery to determine when he can stop this medication. # general infectious work-up: the patient underwent a thorough infectious work-up, including panorex xray, dental consult, tte, tee with bubble study, abdct, serial blood cultures, and assays. abdominal ct with contrast was notable for typhlitis and prominent mesenteric, periaortic, inguinal and femoral lymph nodes. testicular exam was normal. flow cytometry was negative for a lymphoma/leukemia. true etiology of his strep anginosus brain abscess was unclear.

[**known lastname 111991**], thank you for the privilege of participating in your care. you were admitted to the [**hospital1 69**] because you were found to have an infection in your brain (an ""abscess""). we still do not know where this infection came from. we do not know why you developed this infection in your brain. we performed a very thorough workup to investigate where this infection might have come from. a ct scan of your abdomen showed a possible inflammation or infection which might have been the original source of infection. the imaging of the teeth, chest, heart, rest of your body is all reassuring. the brain abscess required treatment with surgery and antibiotics. after your first surgery, imaging showed that the infection could be getting bigger. for this reason, you had to have two more surgeries. the most recent surgery was reassuring that the infection appears to be gone at this time. laboratory cultures from the first surgery showed infection with bacteria. cultures from the second and third operation did not grow any bacteria, indicating that the antibiotics were treating the infection well. also, the neurosurgeons did not see any infection during the third surgery. this is strong evidence that the infection is disappearing. during your hospitalization, you had a very itchy rash, and many high fevers. the rash and fevers were most likely caused by the antibiotics you took after your first surgery. these antibiotics that you seem to have an adverse reaction to are: penicillin, ceftriaxone and meropenem. you are currently on vancomycin and flagyl antibiotics that are fighting the infection. you are tolerating these medications well. you will need to continue the vancomycin and flagyl for a total 4 week course since your last surgery. thus, you should take it through [**7-26**]. the infectious disease doctors [**name5 (ptitle) **] [**name5 (ptitle) 111992**] [**name5 (ptitle) **] when to stop these medications. when you leave the hospital, it is very important that you continue to take all antibiotics as prescribed. if you do not take all your medicines, it is possible that the infection could come back. a nurse will come to your home to help you with the medications. it is also important to take the medication keppra, 1 pill twice a day. this medication will prevent seizures. you should continue this medication until the neurosurgeons tell you that you can stop. it will likely be for several months. please schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor, dr. [**last name (stitle) **]. also, please go to the appointments scheduled with the neurosurgery and infectious disease teams. it is very important that you go to these appointments. your doctors [**name5 (ptitle) 9004**] to be sure that you continue to recover well. you will also have more imaging of your head, to be sure that the infection is getting smaller. here are some instructions from the neurosurgery team: - your sutures should stay clean and dry until they are removed. - do not wash your head where the wound is until [**7-8**]. (10 days after surgery) at that point you can then wash your hair. ?????? have a friend or family member check the wound for signs of infection such as redness or drainage daily. ?????? exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting >10lbs, straining, or excessive bending. ?????? do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as motrin, aspirin, advil, or ibuprofen etc. until follow up. ?????? do not drive until your follow up appointment. followup instructions: follow-up appointment instructions ??????please call ([**telephone/fax (1) 4676**] to schedule an appointment with one of the physician assistant in [**7-18**] days from the time of surgery for staple removal ([**7-9**] you will be due to have the sutures removed). ??????you will need a ct of the brain with contrast in the future. you have an appointment scheduled on [**7-19**] per the neurosurgeons.

[**known lastname 1557**] is a 47 year old woman with h/[**initials (namepattern4) **] [**last name (namepattern4) **] syndrome, multiple abdominal surgeries, resultant short gut syndrome, on chronic tpn, who presented with sepsis and paradoxical emboli. # klebsiella bacteremia - the patient was admitted to the micu with sepsis, likely [**12-27**] to line infection and was started on daptomycin, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and micafungin empirically. her left femoral hickman was replaced by ir on [**9-16**]. initial bcx grew klebsiella, sensitive to ceftriaxone, so the patient was started on ceftriaxone - last day [**2146-10-14**]. she was also given daptomycin and fluconazole from a prior infection until [**2146-10-7**]. she was hemodynamically stable and transferred to the floor with no issues. she was afebrile with no increase in wbc count during her hospitalization. she tolerated the antibiotics well. blood cultures from [**date range (1) 51017**] were negative. ucx were negative as well. the patient had a tte on [**2146-9-19**] to look for vegetations - no vegetations were noted. the patient is to follow up in [**hospital **] clinic upon discharge. # anemia: the patient was transfused with 2u prbc in the micu on [**9-17**] for hct 21.4%, with improvement to 29.1%. ct showed no large rp bleed. the patient's hct remained stable during her hosptialization with no further requirement for transfusion. # asd: the patient has a known asd, first noted on echo in [**2139**]. the tte on [**2146-9-19**] showed new r->l shunt, thought to be [**12-27**] to increased pulmonary pressures from untreated pe from [**3-3**]. she was unable to undergo cardiac mri for better characterization, as she has b/l rods implanted in her femurs for prior leg fractures. she had a tee performed on [**2146-10-4**] that better characterized the asd. it was determined to be suboptimal for closure at this point, so the patient was started on anticoagulation to treat her pe and lower pulmonary pressures. she can be re-evaluated in the future if she continues to have paradoxical emboli. # dysphagia: the patient has noted intermittent symptoms of choking for the past year. she was scheduled for outpatient egd for further evaluation, but has missed all of the appointments in the past year [**12-27**] to hospitalizations. she also failed conscious sedation on one occasion as an outpatient. she was able to undergo egd under general anesthesia while an inpatient. she was found to have an esophageal stricture [**12-27**] to reflux esophagitis. she was started on a ppi [**hospital1 **] for treatment. # pe/multiple line-related thromboses: the patient has a h/o of pe from [**2146-2-23**] that was untreated [**12-27**] to failure of ac with coumadin (supratherapeutic inr [**12-27**] to interactions with abx) and lovenox (adverse reaction - painful welts developed on arms and abdomen). she had been on plavix for the past several months. she was admitted with painful petechiae on her fingers/toes and had episodes of word finding difficulties. it is likely that the clots from her lines were traveling through the asd with the new r->l shunt. the asd was determined to be difficult to close, so anticoagulation was re-addressed. the patient was started on fondaparinux for anticoagulation with instructions to monitor closely for any adverse reactions. she also has outpatient follow up scheduled with hematology to determine the best course of anticoagulation. further work-up for other causes of increased clotting was not done, as the patient has clear risks for clot formation from her multiple stents and indwelling line. # leukopenia: the patient was noted to have leukopenia - wbc ~3, possibly from drug reaction. since daptomycin and fluconazole were being discontinued only several days after the wbc was noted to be decreasing, it was decided to continue these drugs until [**2146-10-7**]. wbc on discharge was 3.0. she should have her wbc closely monitored as an outpatient. medications on admission: fentanyl 150 mcg/hr patch 72 hr clopidogrel 75 mg po daily ondansetron 4 mg rapid dissolve po every 4 hours prn fluconazole 400 mg/200 ml daily daptomycin 275 mg q24h lorazepam 0.5 mg po q6h orn morphine 10-20 mg po q4h as needed for pain. discharge medications: 1. outpatient lab work please draw weekly cbc with diff, bun, cr, ast, alt, alkphos, tbili, ck while the patient is on antibiotics. please fax results to dr.

there were no malignant cells found in either of the fluids and the pericardial window biopsy was negative. also, rheumatology evaluated her and thought it was not secondary to a rheumatological cause because her admission [**doctor first name **] on [**7-6**] was negative (however, she had positive [**doctor first name **] on [**2177-7-25**] times two). her pulmonary status improved and the effusions remained stable so she was discharged to vent-core on [**2177-8-1**]. she did well at the rehabilitation and her course there was actually unknown to us at this point, however, we do know that she was unable to be weaned off of her ventilator. she was currently on cmv with a total volume of 500, respiratory rate of 12 and an fio2 of 40% and had recently failed a ps trial secondary to tachypnea and low volume. recent events at the rehabilitation are summarized below: we know that she recently finished a course of vancomycin and cefepime on [**11-17**], which was begun empirically secondary to a fever. at this time, we do not know the length of time she was on either of these antibiotics. she was recently restarted on lisinopril on approximately [**11-16**]. she does have a history of her creatinine going up on ace inhibitors in the past, however, she was having blood pressures up to the 240s and an attempt was made to restart her on lisinopril which she had not been on since [**month (only) 216**]. her creatinine upon discharge from [**hospital1 190**] ranged from 1.0 to 1.5. she briefly had some elevations of the creatinine into the 2.4 range secondary to acute renal failure from intravenous contrast. they restarted the lisinopril at 10, went up to 20, and discontinued her lisinopril on [**11-20**], as her creatinine had started to rise. it was 3.2 on [**11-21**] and then increased to 3.6 at the outside hospital on [**11-24**]. renal did evaluate her while she was at the rehabilitation and they suggested dialysis as well as an increase in her lasix. she did not undergo dialysis at that time. then, on [**11-21**], a rash was noted to have started that was initially limited and mild but then she underwent desquamation of her skin associated with diffuse erythema and edema. she was also noted to have an eosinophilia since [**2177-10-17**]. we know that her serum eosinophils were 16% on [**11-19**] and had decreased to 12% on [**11-24**]. of note, she had also been on prednisone for an unknown reason. at the rehabilitation it was decided to start weaning this down from 10 mg to 5 mg one week ago. according to the physicians that took care of her at the rehabilitation, her only new medications were lisinopril from approximately [**11-16**] until [**11-20**]. she had been previously on that but not since [**month (only) 216**]. she was also recently started on amlodipine however, it was related that this was started on [**11-22**], after the rash had appeared. all her other hypertensive medications she had been on for quite some time, and the only other recent medications were her antibiotics, vancomycin and cefepime, that were discontinued on [**11-17**], when the course was finished. review of systems: the patient can nod her head with responses and denied pain and shortness of breath at time of admission. past medical history: 1. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: restrictive lung disease with reactive airway disease. 2. status post tracheostomy on [**7-17**] and peg placement on [**2177-7-28**]. her tube feeds are at a goal of 35 cc per hour. she has been unable to be weaned off her ventilator at vent-core. 3. pericardial effusion / tamponade that was found to be exudative with negative cytologies. status post window placement on [**2177-7-9**]. 4. bilateral pleural effusions, transudative, status post left pleurodesis on [**2177-7-9**]. 5. breast cancer (dcif), status post total mastectomy, er-pos, stage 2, no radiation, n0 m0, and currently off tamoxifen. 6. severe hypertension, on five medications. 7. type 2 diabetes mellitus, previously on oral hypoglycemics and now requiring insulin. 8. chronic renal insufficiency secondary to diabetes mellitus with nephrotic range proteinuria. 9. acute renal failure secondary to intravenous dye in [**2177-7-10**]. also had a history of elevated creatinine secondary to ace inhibitors. 10. thalassemia trait. 11. questionable history of osteogenesis imperfecta. 12. legal blindness; she has a left eye prosthesis as well. 13. urinary incontinence. 14. echocardiogram results from [**2177-6-9**] revealed a right ventricular wall clot/tumor with an ejection fraction of 58%. her latest echocardiogram at [**hospital1 188**] on [**2177-7-22**], revealed an ejection fraction of greater than 65%, mild lae, mild symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regular wall motion; mild thickened atrial valve and mitral valve leaflets; moderate pulmonary hypertension; small to moderate pericardial effusion predominantly over the right ventricle. no change when compared to the prior study of [**2177-7-17**]. 15. noted to have vancomycin resistant enterococcus in her urine on [**7-23**]. 16. left ocular paresthesia. 17. anemia; it appears that her baseline hematocrit is usually in the high 20s. 18. spap with 2% gamma band, likely consistent with mgus. upap revealed multiple protein bands without even predominating. 19. urine positive for pseudomonas according to the rn at vent-core. 20. history of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus - question in her sputum. allergies: no known drug allergies. medications on transfer to [**hospital1 **]: 1. amlodipine 10 mg q. day p.o., recently began on [**11-22**], after the rash had appeared. 2. hydralazine 100 mg four times a day; she has been on this medication for a while. please note that the vent-core sheets report that she began this medicine on [**11-21**], however, this was only a renewal according to dr.

heart rate 62; blood pressure 163/43, respiratory rate 12 to 18, 100% o2 saturation; vent settings are assist control, total volume 500, respiratory rate 12, o2 saturation 40% with 5 of peep. in general, the patient opens eyes, nods yes and no to questions. she is an elderly african american female. heent: she has a left eye paresthesia, right eye with questionably sclerae clouded over. sclerae anicteric. oropharynx is clear; there are no mucosal lesions. mucous membranes were moist. neck: tracheostomy is in place. neck is supple. cardiovascular: regular rate and rhythm, normal s1 and s2. respirations: decreased breath sounds at bases. occasional wheeze heard in the left anterior aspect of the well healed abdomen. normoactive bowel sounds. peg is in place. soft, nontender, nondistended. extremities with plus two pitting edema diffusely with no cyanosis or clubbing. extremities are warm; plus two dorsalis pedis is felt on the left, however, could not detect distal pulses on the right extremity. skin: as described by the dermatologic consultation later in the evening; generalized moderate non-colorous erythema with marked desquamation and areas that show evidence of good re-epithelialization. multiple eroded areas in the intertrigous areas of the neck, axillae, breasts and groin. approximately 30% of her back showed superficial erosions and skin sloughing. positive perianal punched out ulcers. also of note, the conjunctivae appears slightly erythematous but on gross examination there were no conjunctival or corneal erosions. neurologic: moves all four extremities. pertinent laboratory: from vent-core on [**11-19**], white blood cell count 24, hematocrit 29.2, platelets 329, mcv of 65 with a differential of 72% polys, 5% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, 16% eosinophils and 1% basophil. from vent-core on [**11-24**], revealed a sodium of 134, potassium of 4.4, chloride of 103, bicarbonate of 22, bun of 130, a creatinine of 3.6 (was 2.4 on [**11-21**] and 3.2 on [**11-19**]). glucose of 111, calcium of 8.6. reportedly had a serum eosinophil percentage of 12. upon admission to [**hospital1 69**], white blood cell count 13.2, hematocrit of 30.1 with an mcv of 66, platelets of 315, pt of 14.4, inr of 1.4, ptt of 28.3. sodium of 135, potassium of 4.9, chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 20, bun of 135, creatinine of 3.6, glucose of 201, calcium of 9.0 corrected to 10.1, phosphorus of 3.4, magnesium of 2.5. alt of 14, ast 22, ld of 233, alkaline phosphatase of 166 which is mildly elevated. total bilirubin of 0.5, albumin of 2,6, lipase of 14, amylase of 20. studies were: 1) portable chest x-ray revealed fairly marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. predominantly left ventricle. pulmonary [**hospital1 56207**] are predominant in the upper zones and some left ventricular failure cannot be excluded. loss of translucency at both lung bases; left diaphragm is elevated. tracheostomy is in satisfactory position. probably bilateral pleural effusions with the question of a left lower lobe infiltrate/atelectasis. 2) renal artery ultrasound from [**2177-6-9**] at [**hospital1 346**] was notable to have a right kidney size of 9.4 and a left kidney size of 9.3. the doppler's were unable to be done. 3) renal artery ultrasound done on [**2177-11-26**], revealed no hydronephrosis, patency of the [**last name (lf) 56207**], [**first name3 (lf) **] the doppler's were not done. the right kidney size was 9.6. the left kidney was unable to be estimated for size due to positional factors, however, it looks grossly normal. hospital course: mrs. [**known lastname 5261**] was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. a dermatology consultation was obtained on the evening of the 17th. their assessment that this was represented likely resolving [**doctor last name **]-[**location (un) **] syndrome versus ten and it seems that it is most consistent with ten. she does show significant re-epithelialization. there is no calor, no tenderness, no bullae evident on examination. her eosinophils have dropped from 16% to 12 in the last few days which suggests improvement in her drug hypersensitivity. these and the fact that her prior antibiotics have now been discontinued, suggests that she is resolving from a prior ten. the most likely culprit for this adverse reaction includes lisinopril which was discontinued on [**11-20**], secondary to the development of acute renal failure. other culprits include vancomycin and the cefepime that had been on board since [**8-1**] and were discontinued on [**11-17**]. cefepime was more likely than vancomycin to cause this adverse drug reaction. these antibiotics should be avoided as well as all ace inhibitors. the amlodipine was also recently added after her rash had begun and at this point until we get the actual medical sheets from the rehabilitation facility, we are holding this amlodipine as well. i have spoken to [**hospital3 105**] vent-core unit, [**location (un) 1773**], where the phone number is [**telephone/fax (1) 26091**], and a nurse there was going to fax the start and stop dates of all the medications she was on during her admission there. we have yet to receive that fax. they also recommended checking urine eosinophils which are currently pending, serum eosinophils which did return on her admission as only 3%, however, the morning of transfer have increased to 7%. liver function tests which were normal except for a slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase as well as ggt of 68 and a bun and creatinine that were at 136 and 3.6 on the morning of [**11-26**]. it was also recommended to follow her electrolytes twice a day. her full electrolytes panel the day of transfer was a sodium of 137, potassium 4.7, chloride 103, bicarbonate of 20, bun of 136, creatinine of 3.6, glucose of 208, calcium of 8.6, phosphorus of 3.2, magnesium of 2.4. of note, she also had a white blood cell count of 13.1, hematocrit of 31.3, platelets of 324, with a differential of 78% neutrophils, 1% bands, 7% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, 7% eosinophils and 1% metas. for her skin we were placing xeroderm patches as well as using bactroban instead of bacitracin to her wounds. the next morning, dermatology obtained two 5 mm skin punch biopsies at the left parasternal line under sterile conditions and were sent to pathology for a diagnosis. an epidermal jelly-roll from epidermis adjacent to fresh erosion also sent in, however, on dermatology fellow's examination, there were no bullae, only erosions. the biopsy sites were sutured with #5 ethilon, two sutures were used at each site. these sutures will need to be removed in approximately two weeks. the above procedure was done by [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**last name (namepattern1) 103104**], pager number [**serial number 103105**] [**hospital1 756**]. they also recommended swabbing the neck erosions for cultures which look slightly purulent. other entities on differential diagnoses include staphylococcus skin syndrome, which is possible but probably not likely in this case. we did sent pan-cultures for urine, sputum and blood. we also started her on normal saline fluids at a rate of only 60 cc per hour for now. we were concerned that she might have had some congestive heart failure on her chest x-ray. also, she had a very small intravenous line that was in her finger and we were worried about losing access overnight. her intakes and outputs over an eight hour period overnight was 925 cc in with a urine output of 305 cc per hour. her other work-up for the rash revealed an esr of 20 which is high normal, a tsh and [**doctor first name **] which are pending, and a rheumatoid factor which returned as negative. 2. infectious disease: she was placed on precautions upon admission here for a history of vre in the urine, which was treated with linezolid in [**2177-6-9**]. also with a history of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus. all antibiotics were held at this point and her white blood cell count, though, was slightly elevated (she is on prednisone), which was basically normal and she was afebrile. dermatology also suggested getting viral cultures of the punched out lesions of the peri-rectal area that they saw. other infectious disease issues were that the sputum culture gram stain had returned with greater than 25 polys, less than 10 epithelials, however, four plus gram negative rods. her secretions were slightly yellow and thick but as she was afebrile and was in the setting of an acute rash, session: did not start antibiotics. her blood cultures from [**11-25**] were no growth to date so far. 3. renal: the patient is in acute renal failure; likely multi-factorial including recent ace inhibitor, pre-renal causes secondary to a recent increased dose of her lasix, like maybe congestive heart failure, poor oncotic pressure secondary to low albumin and nephrotic range proteinuria. likely ain, especially given increased peripheral eosinophils as well as rash. we decided to send her urine for electrolytes as well as urine for urine urea to check an fe urea. these are pending at the time of this dictation. urine eos were sent. we obtained a renal ultrasound and the results are listed above. she was put in for a cardiac echocardiogram and we decided to rule out myocardial infarction in case myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure had occurred in this case. 4. hypertension: the patient was continued on hydralazine 100 four times a day; clonidine 0.3 three times a day; metoprolol 100 four times a day, labetalol 200 q. six hours; isosorbide 40 three times a day, but the amlodipine was held. her blood pressure had ranged from 143 to 174 systolic overnight. it was decided to initiate a work-up for the secondary causes of her hypertension. it appears that since her kidneys are both of normal size, even though dopplers were unable to be done, that the likelihood of renal artery stenosis was maybe low, however, the test is not definitive. at this time, we are avoiding all ace inhibitors. 5. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: we are continuing albuterol and atrovent mdi. 6. for diabetes mellitus type 2, we initiated four times a day fingersticks with a regular insulin sliding scale as well as continue her nph insulin at 20 units q. a.m. and 20 units q. p.m. 7. for her anemia with her a very low mcv which is likely secondary to her history of thalassemia trait. a type and screen was sent and her epogen was continued. 8. gastrointestinal: she was continued on colace and p.r.n. bisacodyl. her tube feeds were started. stools were guaiac, however, she had not had a stool. a ggt was checked because of her elevated alkaline phosphatase and this was also found to be elevated at a level of 68. 9. history of pericardial effusion status post window. this is another reason that we wanted to check a transthoracic echocardiogram. she had cardiomegaly on chest x-ray, however, there is no evidence of tamponade on her ekg. 10. fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: most of this was already discussed in the renal section. she was gently hydrated with normal saline 60 cc per hour overnight. the bun and creatinine appear to have maybe remained stable now. she had hypoalbuminemia and nutrition was consulted. we are continuing her calcium carbonate. we are also continuing free water boluses 125 cc per hour q. eight hours per the g-tube. however, if her sodium continues to decrease, then these can be stopped. her electrolytes probably need to be followed twice a day. 11. ventilator: she is currently on assist control 500 x 12, 5 of peep/40% saturation and is saturating well. there is no current reason to change her ventilation settings at this time. 12. prophylaxis: she is on subcutaneous heparin and protonix. 13. tubes, lines and drains: she arrived to the floor with one very small peripheral intravenous in her left finger. a consultation in the a.m. was put in for a stat picc line. the interventional team had assessed her at the bedside and at the time of this dictation, it appears that she will not be undergoing picc placement, but rather will attempt to place some sort of central line. it is unknown exactly how we are going to obtain this access at the point of this dictation. a foley catheter is in place. 14. full code. condition at discharge: fair. discharge status: it was recommended by dermatology that she would benefit from transfer to a burn unit. at this time, she has been accepted to go to the [**hospital6 **] burn unit. of note, it was decided not to start her on intravenous igg at this point. discharge medications: 1. amlodipine 10 mg q. day p.o., recently began on [**11-22**], after the rash had appeared, but has been held today. 2. hydralazine 100 mg four times a day; she has been on this medication for a while. please note that the vent-core sheets report that she began this medicine on [**11-21**], however, this was only a renewal according to dr. [**last name (stitle) **]. 3. lasix 40 mg twice a day. 4. nph 20 units twice a day. 5. h2o 125 cc three times a day. 6. benadryl 25 mg q. eight hours. 7. subcutaneous heparin 5000 twice a day. 8. prednisone 5 mg q. day. 9. protein soy supplement, two scoops in the feeding tube q. eight hours. 10. nepro 3/4 strength tube feeds 35 cc per hour. 11. clonidine 0.3 three times a day. 12. bisacodyl 10 mg q. day p.r.n. 13. regular insulin sliding scale with humulin. 14. lopressor 100 mg four times a day. 15. labetalol 200 mg four times a day. 16. isosorbide dinitrate 40 mg q. eight hours. 17. sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n. 18. protonix 40 q. day. 19. epogen 40,000 units subcutaneously weekly. 20. brimonidine 0.2% solution, one drop bilaterally q. eight hours. 21. eiazdolamide one drop solution to each eye three times a day. 22. ativan 1 mg q. eight hours. 23. calcium carbonate 500 mg q. eight hours. 24. ipratropium and albuterol mdi four puffs q. four hours p.r.n. discharge diagnoses: 1. acute renal failure. 2. rash most consistent with toxic epidermal necrolysis (ten). 3. severe hypertension on several anti-hypertensive. 4. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 5. status post tracheostomy [**7-17**] and peg [**7-28**]. 6. status post pericardial effusion with window placement on [**7-9**]. 7. history of bilateral pleural effusion. 8. history of breast cancer as above. 9. type 2 diabetes mellitus.

on arrival to the [**hospital unit name 153**] noted to be lethargic not responding well to commands, oriented only to name. mental status improved with one dose of narcan, making medication effect likely source of ams as patient had received morphine in ed, in addition to home morphine/oxycodone. in addition, patient had received medications during her observation stay in the emergency room just a day prior to this admission. she insists that her chronic pain medications were not the cause of her change in mental status and her hypotension, but rather that the additional medications she received in the ed during her observation stay were culprit. she insisted on being very responsible regarding her medications. as medications have worn off, patient is now awake and alert. head ct negative for subdural in the setting of fall. patient was febrile in the ed, but is now hemodynamically stable without other fevers and cxr negative for pneumonia, making infection unlikely source of ams. patient remained lucid for the remainder of the admission, and was seen to be extremely anxious to go home. #hypotension: patient with hypotension to sbp 80s in the ed (baseline sbp 110-160). bp now stable in 120??????s since admission to the icu. given blood pressure normalized following clearance of opioids, likely opioid-induced. no further evidence of infection to support sepsis as etiology. troponin x 2 negative for evidence of cardiac ischemia. systolic blood pressures started to rise to 150 at the time of discharge so patient was instructed to continue all of her home antihypertensives. #h/o asthma - pt was reportedly wheezy in ed. s/p 125mg solumedrol. lungs clear for the remainder of the admission. #h/o anxiety - holding home diazepam in setting of ams, but patient was clearly anxious to be discharged from the hospital, and insisted on repeating every detail of her history. #h/o left wrist fracture - on long acting morphine and oxycodone at home. in setting of ams and lethargy/unresponsiveness, these medications were initially held. however, these are patient's long standing medications, so she will continue to use them, as they have not caused lethargy or change in mental status in the past. vitamin d level ordered and is pending at time of discharge. #chronic back pain- patient to resume home medications on discharge medications on admission: medications: per pcp [**name initial (pre) 626**] [**2200-5-16**] medications -

time/date. she had no further siezures and we feel that her sz were from uti giving her a metabolic derangement. we also found that the patient has a poor compliance with medications and is almost paranoid about letting people help her with her medications. initially pt had an elevation in her troponin to 1.07 and a downtrend (see lab section). cardiology has been involved. pt has had several episodes of chest pain on the floor, and has had several more ekg's showing no evidence of acute infarct. cardiology was reconsulted and recommended persantine studies, but as pt would not want to proceed with catheterization, there is no utility to pursuing this study at this time. chest pain was not felt to be cardiac in origin. medications on admission: dilantin 200/100/200, sodium

the sigmoid, but without discrete fluid collection. this is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of ischemic colitis, particularly in the rectosigmoid region. no evidence of obstruction or perforation. 2) patent major branches, with vascular calcifications. patency of superior mesenteric vein and portal vein also demonstrated. no intraluminal filling defects identified, however, ischemia is not definitively excluded on the basis of this study. 3) cyst in right kidneys; low-density lesions in left kidney and liver, too small to fully characterize, but also probably representing cysts. 4) bilateral small pleural effusions. brief hospital course: a/p: 72 y/o f w/dementia, cad, cva, p/w seizures and brbpr: 1. gi bleed: she was followed by gi and surgery and had a tagged rbc scan which was consistent with a rectosigmoid bleed. she then underwent colonoscopy which showed ischemic colitis in that area while in the micu. she was placed on prophylactic gi antimicrobial coverage while in the icu. she did not require a blood transfusion and as she was stable, was transferred after colonoscopy to the floor. on the floor, ct angiogram of the abdomen was done to evaluate her bowel wall and vasculature was done as she was still having pain. this was again consistent with rectosigmoid ischemic colitis with significant bowel wall edema. her abdominal pain slowly resolved. her hematocrit did trend down slowly from 37-39 on the day of admission to 32 at discharge but she did not meet our criteria for blood transfusion. she has a baseline b12 deficiency for which she takes supplements, however, this anemia was thought to be from a slow gi ooze. her reticulocyte count was at 1.6. her diet was slowly advanced, and she tolerated this without difficulty. we placed her on a low dose aspirin instead of her prior full strength, weighing the risk of bleeding with the opposing risk of her significant underlying ischemic arterial disease. her antibiotics were discontinued. she was started on protonix iv and discharged on po protonix for gi prophylaxis. she will need a repeat colonsocopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy in [**4-26**] weeks to assess for complete resolution. . 2. seizures: head ct ruled out bleed and she had no residual neurologic defects. given her history, and as she had a witnessed seizure she was loaded with iv dilantin 500 iv x1, then placed on standing dilantin iv while she was npo. once she was eating, tegretol was restarted and once the tegretol level was at goal ([**3-8**]), the dilantin was discontinued. her nightly tegretol dose was increased. 3. arf: her creatinine peaked at 1.2 at admission. this resolved to baseline ~0.8, with hydration and was thought to be secondary to prerenal azotemia. . 4. cad: her asa was initially held, and her beta blocker was initially dosed at 1/2 her home dose in the micu. the beta blocker was eventually resumed at her full dose but her asa was restarted at 81mg instead on the floor, as discussed above. we continued her lisinopril and resumed her statin at transfer to the floor. . 5. ppx: maintained on protonix iv and then switched to po, pneumoboots . 6. adverse pneumococcal vaccine reaction: after receiving the pneumococcal vaccine, per hospital protocol for all patients in her age group who have not been previously immunized, the patient developed erythema, induration, and pain at the injection site in her right deltoid consistent with an adverse vaccine reaction. prior to receiving this vaccination, the patient's daughter and hcp had specifically been questioned about her mother's vaccination history and she denied that her mother had received the pneumoccocal vaccine in the past. the patient received standing tylenol, and prn ibuprofen, and ice packs for pain with improvement. the adverse reaction was duly reported to appropriate hospital and federal authorities. . 7. hypothyroidism: we continued her home dose of synthroid. . 8. alzheimers: she was mostly pleasantly demented, but sundowned with agitation and wandering requiring frequent redirection. her living situation was discussed with her children, and per her daughter and hcp, her children will personally provide 24 hour monitoring for her at the patient's home, with eventual plans to find a [**hospital1 1501**]. they deffered our offer to help provide

ct w/o contrast ([**6-5**]): impression: 1. no acute cervical fracture or malalignment. 2. multilevel severe degenerative changes of the cervical spine as detailed above. cxr ([**6-5**]): findings: pa and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate a previously 5.8 x 3.6 cm left upper lobe lung mass, now measuring 8.7 x 6.5 cm with interval cavitation and a new air-fluid level, which presumably represents a cavitated bronchogenic carcinoma with necrotic contents. superimposed infection cannot be excluded. this lesion abuts the anterior left hilus. no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. the cardiac silhouette is normal in size. the mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. the aortic knob is partially calcified without dilatation. cxr ([**6-7**]): impression: ap chest compared to [**6-5**]: slight increase in the heart size and heterogeneous opacification at the lung bases could be due to dependent edema, but raises more concern for pneumonia. the large cavitated mass in the left upper lobe contains a fair amount of fluid. there is the possibility of internal aspiration. no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion is present. echo ([**6-6**]): there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. the left ventricular cavity size is normal. regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (lvef>55%). there is no ventricular septal defect. right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. the aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. there is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). trace aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is no mitral valve prolapse. mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is a very small pericardial effusion. there are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. brief hospital course: patient is a 79 year-old gentleman with history of melanoma, presumptive squamous cell lung cancer with cxray revealing enlargening cavitated bronchogenic carcinoma with necrotic contents, and known osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions in the t-spine most likely from metastases presenting with pain, malaise, and falls at home, transferred to icu for a. fib with rvr which resolved with amiodarone. # altered mental status/encephalopathy: pt's mental status reportedly worsened in the setting of having his fentanyl patch increased from 25mcg to 50 mcg. moreover, the patient was found to be hypercalcemic and hypotensive on presentation. all three factors likely resulted in his ams, with resolution after decrease of his fentanyl patch, treatment and resolution of his hypercalcemia, and discontinuation of his home blood pressure medications. the patient should refrain from having increased fentanyl patch doses. infectious work-up was negative. # atrial fibrillation: patient with no known history of atrial fibrillation, developed a. fib with rvr and rate related ekg changes. precipitant unclear, but possibly etiology includes chronic disease (pt with h/o htn), pulmonary disease (patient with known copd), irritation of left atria from left lung mass, and echo revealing mild lvh, mild mr and as, so patient is good substrate. patient with rate related ekg changes that went away with better rate control. no chest pain, no dyspnea. cardiac markers normal and tsh wnl. in er was started on diltiazem gtt but became hypotensive so was admitted to the micu and started on an amiodarone gtt with a loading dose. rates better controlled with this but bp still low so amio stopped on am of [**6-6**] and pt returned to nsr. echo with mild as and small pericardial effusion without tamponade (likely malignancy related). given the patient's goals of care and falls at home, anticoagulation was not pursued. the patient's care is focused on comfort. the patient may continue his aspirin 325 mg. # hypotension: patient initially admitted to the micu for hypotension (and afib with rvr) which seemed to have developed in the setting of starting a diltiazem drip. responded to ivf but reocurred later with amiodarone drip. given more fluids and bp fine although low once amio/dilt were stopped. did not require pressors during icu stay. the patient was transferred to the floor. his blood pressures were within normal limits throughout his stay off the multi-drug hypertension regimen he was on at home. the patient states he takes too many medications, does not want to take htn medications, and his blood pressures were persistently in the 100s-140 range. he states that he used to have sbps in the 200s and felt fine. he should not be treated for his hypertension unless he requests it, becomes symptomatic, or sbps>200. initiating medications for htn should be discussed with the patient. am cortisol level wnl. # pain: patient with increasing pain of his shoulders and neck, receiving increasing doses of fentanyl patches without adequate relief. pain possibly secondary to malignancy. no evidence of fracture on ct c-spine. started on standing tylenol and contact[**name (ni) **] pcps office who confirmed home fentanyl patch had recently been uptitrated to 50mcg/hr q72hrs. rn at pcps office said that patient had increasing issues with confusion and falls on this higher dose and they were concerned that it was too much narcotic for him. in micu pt placed on fentanyl patch at 25mcg/hr and given prn oxycodone for breakthrough. pain remained reasonably well controlled. given the patient's desire to avoid confusion and his adverse reaction to higher doses of fentanyl beyond his current dose of 25 mcg/hr, the patient was placed on standing tylenol and a lidocaine patch. he should also be given ibuprofen 200-400 mg q4-6h prn for pain before being given oxycodone as his renal function tolerates. notably, the patient's focus is on having clear mentation over pain control, so care should be taken before administering the low dose opiates. #cavitary lung mass most likely from squamous cell carcinoma - pt with history of melanoma but the lung mass appears to be primary squamous cell lung carcinoma. the patient has past sputum cytology with highly atypical squamous cells suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma which in setting of appearence on imaging and hypercalcemia is most consistent with lung cancer. the diagnosis and stage are unknown because the patient refuses biopsy and further work-up. these have been clearly stated in his records here as well as via discussion with the patient and his family on this admission. palliative care engaged in open discussion with patient and confirmed his goals of care. the patient understands the potential for his course of disease to worsen. the patient requests to be dnr/dni with plans for no aggressive care and focus on comfort and quality of life. # hypercalcemia: patient with elevated calcium to 12.3 (corrected ca2+=13.1) and low phos. patient with known lytic and blastic lesions in thoracic spine. pt was given ns for this with improvement. a pth was appropriately low. the patient was given pamidronate 60 mg on [**6-7**] with improvement in calcium, 9.9 on discharge. pamidronate can be repeated as needed at least a week after initial dose. # acute kidney injury: creatinine increased to 1.9, up from most recent baseline of 1.2. likely hypovolemic secondary to poor po intake. creatinine improved with fluids. the patient was briefly diuresed for his lower extremity edema which resulted in a rise in his creatinine from 1.4 to 1.6. subsequent diuresis was held with improvement of his creatinine to 1.3 at discharge. the patient is very volume sensitive/preload dependent likely from his diastolic dysfunction from lvh and aortic stenosis. thus, if diuresis is initiated for his swelling, it should be done carefully and gingerly with close eye on renal function. # acute on chronic diastolic chf: patient with 2+ swelling of lower extremities. there is likely an element of decreased oncotic pressure as well given the patient's low albumin. patient's bnp was 6600 and echo revealed mild lvh, mr, and as, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. lvef was well preserved. the patient was tried on two doses of iv lasix with improvement in volume status but worsened renal function. the patient is likely quite preload dependent, and thus if diuresis is given, it should be gently. #hypertension, benign: patient with history of poorly controlled hypertension on six anti-hypertensives. no evidence of hypertension here. pt with excellent blood pressure control despite all medications being discontinued. patient states he previously had sbps in 200s without any symptoms and not on medications. he does not wish to take any htn meds and wants to keep his medical list simple. #copd: patient with 40 pack year smoking history and history of copd, but no dyspnea, no wheezing. continued on homoe spiriva #cva s/p r cea: continue aspirin and lipitor #code status: dnr/dni - emphasis on quality of life and limiting procedures. future hospitalizations should be discussed with patient. transitional: 1) the patient's priority is to maintain a clear mental status. as such, we have started ibuprofen in order to help with pain without using opiates, but the patient's renal function should be monitored carefully with nsaid use. 2) the patient also wants his pain well controlled, but is more concerned about maintaining a clear mental status 3) pamidraonte was given here on [**6-7**] for osteolysis of his spine from his malignancy. it can be retreated as needed as long as it is 7 days after previous dose 4) the patient states that he would like discussion before hospitalization in the future. he may not want to be hospitalized depending on the situation 5) the patient states he does not want to go home. he would feel more comfortable with people taking care of him. he currently lives alone. after rehab, there will need to be ongoing discussion with patient and family about where he should go, as he feels that he cannot take care of himself. he currently lives alone at home, with nurses that come just a few times a week. 6) notable labs on last check: hct 30.1, bun 29, cr 1.3. medications on admission: -

[**2144-3-22**]: the patient was admitted. patient with low grade fever 100.4, white blood cell count was normal at 7.9. [**2144-3-22**]: the patient was in the preop orthopedics area prior to surgery. became hypotensive with rapid atrial fibrillation, heart rates in the 140s to 150s. the patient was taken back to the floor, and intravenous diltiazem was pushed. blood cultures that were taken on admission subsequently grew out gram positive coxae. the patient was started on vancomycin empirically. [**2144-3-23**]: right ij perm-a-cath pulled by transplant surgery. [**2144-3-24**]: temporary line number one was placed in her right groin by renal. [**2144-3-26**]: question of endocarditis. pte is negative. [**2144-3-28**]: temporary groin line number one in the right femoral area was discontinued by renal. [**2144-3-31**]: question infectious fossae from the gram positive coxae bacteremia, which has subsequently grown out to be mrsa. white blood cell scan was obtained to evaluate for septa fossae given the fact that the patient had a right temporary groin line in, has an old left av [**doctor last name 4726**]-tex graft. the white blood cell scan was negative or any septic fossaei. it showed increased uptake in the bone marrow (consistent with infectious process), and increase uptake in the sacral area, consistent with her sacral decubitus ulcers. [**2144-3-30**]: nasogastric tube was placed. tube feeds and po medications administered this way. [**2144-3-31**]: temporary right groin line hemodialysis number two was placed. [**2144-4-2**]: transplant surgery is unable to place a left or right ij or right subclavian. procedure was aborted in the operating room. [**2144-4-2**]: left open reduction and internal fixation, dhs by orthopedics surgery procedure. no problems or complications. [**2144-4-4**]: left ij perm-a-cath placed by transplant surgery. postoperatively, the patient had increased white blood cells in urine, hypotensive. the patient was neo-synephrine. transferred to the micu. since her blood cultures from [**3-21**] through [**3-25**] were positive, since [**2144-3-25**] cultures have been negative. [**2144-4-5**]: urine cultures are growing out proteus. blood cultures are with gram negative bacteremia in the micu. the patient was started on levofloxacin. the patient was also weaned off neo-synephrine. [**2144-4-7**]: the patient is growing out gram positive coxae in her blood cultures. presumed to be enterococcus, started on linezolid given her recent hip surgery as well as port-a-cath. [**2144-4-8**]: the patient was transferred back to the floor hemodynamically stable. [**2144-4-9**]: infectious disease was reconsulted. [**2144-4-10**]: picc was placed on the right basilic vein. right groin line (was pulled). [**2144-4-11**]: left perm-a-cath is malfunctioning. there was no flow. hemodialysis was aborted. [**2144-4-13**]: interventional radiology replaced a perm-a-cath in the same site. [**2144-4-14**]: ir had to change the perm-a-cath again, ? puncture of the first perm-a-cath they placed when changing over a guidewire. [**2144-4-15**]: the patient developed a right common femoral vein, superficial femoral vein deep venous thrombosis. [**2144-4-17**]: increased alkaline phosphatase to the 190s. right upper quadrant ultrasound showed gallstones, in common bile duct 3 mm, no acute process. [**2144-4-18**] - [**2144-4-19**]: the patient's inr is therapeutic. heparin was discontinued. hospital course: 1. orthopedic: the patient has a left intratrochanteric hip fracture. it was repaired by orthopedic surgery with a left open reduction and internal fixation and dynamic hip screw on [**2144-4-2**]. the patient tolerated the procedure well. no problems. 2. cardiovascular: the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, with a history of rapid ventricular response. various times throughout the admission she has required 10 to 20 mg if intravenous diltiazem to bring her rate down. she is currently stable on a po (via nasogastric tube) regimen of metoprolol 50 mg po t.i.d. 3. renal: the patient has end stage renal disease on hemodialysis. hemodialysis is typically done on tuesday, thursday, saturday. she has had numerous transplant catheter perm-a-cath issue as dated above with the time line synopsis. she currently has a left sided perm-a-cath, which is functioning well. 4. prophylaxis: the patient was placed on a ppi, and then switched to ppi intravenous when she was not taking po and then was changed to h2 blocker via her nasogastric tube. because she is a renal patient lovenox should not be used as the levels cannot be monitored. the patient was initiated on a heparin drip with various therapeutic levels, when she developed the right femoral vein/right common femoral vein/right superficial femoral vein deep venous thrombosis. her right thigh was greatly enlarged and tender to palpation. she was started on coumadin and was therapeutic on coumadin times two days before the heparin was discontinued. per orthopedic recommendations the patient is to remain anticoagulated for six weeks postoperatively. the patient's surgery was on [**2144-4-2**], and she should be anticoagulated for six weeks postoperatively. recommend reultrasound of her right thigh in six weeks to determine the presence/absence/resolution of deep venous thrombosis. given the fact that this patient is nonmobile, she is likely to need anticoagulation or prophylactic anticoagulation with subq heparin for the time that she is immobile/decreased mental status/not walking/nonmobile at all. of note, her right popliteal vein is patent. 5. allergies/adverse reactions: the patient is exquisitely sensitive to narcotics. 1 mg of morphine causes this patient to have decreased mental status for approximately one to two to three days. narcotics (darvocet/percocet/morphine) should be judiciously avoided in this patient. 6. pulmonary: throughout this patient's entire admission her oxygen saturation has remained 95 to 100% on room air. she shows no signs of aspiration pneumonia, though she is an aspiration risk. recommend keeping her bed at 30 degrees to 45 degrees and using all aspiration precautions. serial chest x-rays were obtained on this patient, which have been negative for any pneumonia. she does have coarse breath sounds anteriorly, which sounds like transmitted upper airway sounds. 7. left foot drop: the patient has a left foot drop, which is consistent with a peroneal nerve distribution. mri of the lumbosacral spine was obtained to evaluate for any anatomic abnormalities. the mri showed numerous compression fractures in l3-s1 region, but no distinct abnormalities that would cause a specific foot drop. her foot drop is likely secondary to compression from behind her knee, during orthopedic surgery or secondary to placement of her legs while she was [**date range **]. no nerve conduction studies were done. 8. decreased mental status: the patient has had a decreased mental status since admission on [**2144-3-21**]. she has had numerous cts, white blood cell scans of her head, which have all revealed no evidence of subdural hematomas, no intracranial or axial hemorrhage, no evidence of any infarcts. there are no mass lesions or any shift effect. her decreased mental status is likely secondary to her toxic/metabolic state. a lumbar puncture was considered, however, the patient's mental status has been improving over the week prior to discharge and she is now able to state her name and communicate somewhat though this does wax and wane. it is anticipated that her mental status should clear somewhat as her medical condition improves, however, and she has a depressed mental status times one month, question how much toxic metabolic recovery she will have. 9. mrsa/bacteremia: the patient completed vancomycin treatment times twelve days. in addition, after the patient was placed on linezolid this would also cover mrsa bacteremia as well. 10. proteus urinary tract infection, causing sepsis: the patient completed a two week cousre of levofloxacin. 11. vre bacteremia: the patient is to finish completing a two week cousre of linezolid. this cousre will end on [**2144-4-23**]. 12. anticoagulation: the patient is to continue anticoagulation for six weeks [**last name (lf) **], [**first name3 (lf) **] [**2144-4-2**] orthopedics surgery. recommend continuing ppi/h2 blocker. 13. right deep venous thrombosis, common femoral vein, superficial femoral vein, with a greatly enlarged right thigh: [**initials (namepattern4) **] [**last name (namepattern4) 260**] filter was considered for prophylaxis against pulmonary embolis. however, it is thought that the patient had her heparin turned on and off intermittently for different procedures and though her heparin levels were therapeutic, question of whether she had transient subtherapeutic levels that were not detectable by laboratory, which may have contributed to her tpt. it is recommended she discontinue all anticoagulation. 14. fen: the patient is being given tube feeds (nephro/renal diet) per nutrition recommendations. the patient has had an nasogastric tube in her nose since [**2144-3-30**]. if the patient's mental status does not improve within the next month, ? consideration of a peg. when the patient is more awake recommend a bedside speech and swallow evaluation for this patient. she is npo except for ice chips right now. she is an aspiration risk and her head of the bed should be elevated at 30 degrees to 45 degrees. she showed no signs of aspiration pneumonia at this time. 15. hypoglycemia: the patient is on regular insulin sliding scale. her finger sticks have been in the range from the 100s to 250. recommend continuing insulin sliding scale. if her blood glucose level is greater then 200 consistently, recommend starting low dose of nph. 16. elevated alkaline phosphatase: total bilirubin is normal. the patient has a history of increased alkaline phosphatase. a ggt level was obtained, which was 114. right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed gallstones, but no gallbladder wall thickening and a common bile duct of 3 mm. no cholecystitis. no abdominal pain, no right upper quadrant tenderness. abdominal examination has been benign. 17. code status: the patient is full code per her families wishes. discharge disposition: the patient is to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility. discharge medications: 1. atorvastatin 20 mg po q.h.s. 2. tylenol 325 to 650 mg po q 4 to 6 hours prn. 3. miconazole powder b.i.d. prn. 4. linezolid 600 mg po q 12 hours times three days through [**2144-4-22**]. 5. ranitidine 150 mg po q.d. 6. metoprolol 50 mg po t.i.d. 7. coumadin 2.5 mg po q.h.s. 8. regular insulin sliding scale. 9. epoetin 3000 units subq three times per week (monday, wednesday and friday). discharge instructions: 1. inr levels should be checked q day to monitor for variations. she is to be kept therapeutic with an inr level between 2 to 3. if her inr is stabilized, inr can be checked q week. she is to be anticoagulated for six weeks [**month/day/year **] orthopedic surgery. 2. the patient requires hemodialysis for her end stage renal disease. typically on tuesday, thursday, saturday. this is to be arranged by renal/hemodialysis team. 3. the patient has low grade fevers and it is recommended that she recieve blood cultures times two, urinalysis via straight catheter as well as urinary culture. 4. if mental status has not improved in the next several weeks recommended peg tube for administration of medications as well as tube feeds. discharge diagnoses: 1. mrsa bacteremia. 2. vre bacteremia. 3. proteus urinary tract infection leading to sepsis/proteus bacteremia. 4. left intratrochanteric hip fracture. 5. end stage renal disease on hemodialysis. 6. atrial fibrillation, with rvr. 7. altered mental status. 8. left foot drop. 9. vertebral compression fractures. 10. diabetes mellitus type 2. 11. hypertension. 12. gastroesophageal reflux disease. 13. question congestive heart failure, ef is approximately 80%. left ventricular systolic function was hyperdynamic. trivial mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, left atrium mildly dilated. this is per an echocardiogram done on [**2144-3-26**]. 14. status post numerous perm-a-cath placements/removal. 15. right deep venous thrombosis. 16. elevated alkaline phosphatase of unknown significance.

[**2192-3-22**] cxr: findings: as compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. unchanged low lung volumes, unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. no focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia. . [**2192-3-23**] cxr: 1. moderate cardiomegaly with increased moderate pulmonary edema compared to [**2192-3-22**]. 2. retrocardiac opacity most likely represents left basilar atelectasis. however, the differential diagnoses include layering left-sided pleural effusion, increased pulmonary edema, aspiration or pneumonia in the correct clinical setting. . [**2192-3-24**] cxr: there is again a tracheostomy tube in place, in good position. there is overall interval decrease in left lung base opacity compared to the prior examination. the left costophrenic angle is not seen. right hemithorax is unremarkable. no evidence of pneumothorax. no new parenchymal opacity is visualized. remainder of the examination is unchanged. kidney ultrasound [**2192-3-30**]: findings: no hydronephrosis of the right kidney or left kidney. the bipolar diameter of the right kidney is 9.8 cm and left kidney 8.8 cm. a 0.3 cm x 0.2 cm x 0.3 cm non-obstructing calculus is identified at the mid to lower pole of the right kidney. no other calculi are seen in the right kidney. a tiny hyperechoic focus at the mid pole of the left kidney most likely represents crystals and a caliceal diverticulum. no other focal abnormalities are seen in the left kidney. the urinary bladder is empty with a foley catheter in situ. liver ultrasound [**2192-3-30**]: findings: overall, evaluation is very limited by difficult son[**name (ni) 493**] penetration. no definite focal hepatic lesion is seen. the patient is status post cholecystectomy. dilation of the extrahepatic common duct to 1.2 cm is noted in the setting of mild left intra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation, findings which are unchanged since a cta chest from 11/[**2189**]. the main portal vein demonstrates normal hepatopetal flow. no free fluid is seen in the right upper quadrant. impression: unchanged biliary ductal dilatation may be related to prior cholecystectomy, however the etiology is not completely certain. mrcp may be utilized for further evaluation, if clinically indicated. chest x ray [**2192-4-3**]: the patient has chronic low lung volumes which limit intrathoracic evaluation. the left pleural scarring/pleural effusion is unchanged . cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged, also unchanged. tracheostomy tube is grossly normal. right picc terminates with its tip in the mid to distal svc. impression: no pulmonary edema or infectious process. brief hospital course: # dyspnea/respiratory distress: when pt arrived on the floor she was tachypnic and somnolent. she was sating 88-90% on 100% trach mask. normally she is on 2.5 liters trach mask at home. there was concern for chf exacerbation so lasix was given and pt had thick yellow urine. abg was 7.30/66/55. resp therapy was called to beside. pt has a size 6 cuffless trach. suctioning removed thick yellow secretions and sats improved to 97% on 50% trach mask. there was also some concern of twave changes on her ekg. she was transferred to the micu [**2192-3-24**] for respiratory distress. in the unit the patient had her trach changed to a cuffed trach in case she needed to be vented. however, she did not require this. she received nebs, suctioning, and iv lasix (80 mg with good result). cultures were obtained and the patient was empirically treated for pneumonia with cefepime and flagyl. the patient remained afebrile and her flagyl was stopped. the cefepime was kept as she had evidence of uti on ua. at time of transfer out from the icu to the medicine floor the patient had been diuresed 12 l over the length of stay. the patient continued to be diuresed on the medicine floor. however, she lost her iv access and received 80 mg lasix po bid instead of by iv. she continued to receive her albuterol, ipratropium, acetyl cysteine nebs. her o2 sats improved and she was able to tolerate fio2 of 35% which roughly corresponded to her 2.5 l o2 at home. she remained afebrile and her shortness of breath returned to baseline. the source of her exacerbation is unclear as she states she was compliant with medications and diet. she should continue her salt restricted diet, diuretics, and daily weight monitoring. #) assymptomatic bacteriuria: from chronic foley catheter (which was placed for neurogenic bladder). the patient was found to have a dirty ua and was initially started on cefepime in the icu. urine cultures grew klebsiella senisitive to cipro but the patient was allergic to floroquinolones so she was started on bactrim. however, this caused acute interstitial nephritis so it was stopped on day 5. her foley was changed and a repeat urinalysis and culture showed 6 wbcs, and 10,000 to 100,000 bacteria that eventually grew e coli (esbl). she was not started on antibiotics given that she was assymptomatic, has a chronic indwelling catheter and is likely colonized, there were less than 100,000 bacteria in the sample, and she has had multiple adverse reactions to antibiotics including her recent ain. she should get a repeat ua and culture when she goes to her follow up appointment with her pcp. [**name10 (nameis) **] patient was counseled to call her doctor or return to the ed if she felt like she was developing a uti. #) acute renal failure/acute interstitial nephritis: the pateint presented to the hospital with cr 1.6 up from 1.1. her creatinine improved to 0.8 with diuresis supporting poor forward flow as the cause of her arf. she developed acute renal failure again after starting the bactrim for her uti. her creatinine bumped up to 2.1 on day # 5 of antibiotics. renal was consulted and recommended stopping bactrim. after this was stopped her creatinine slowly improved. it was 1.1 the day of discharge. she should list bactrim as an allergy due to ain and not take this in the future. #) dyspepsia/nausea/transaminitis/hepatitis: on hospital day 8 the patient developed nausea that was first thought to be due to worsening gastroparesis as it was noticed she was not receiving her home reglan. this medication was restarted but the patient continued to have nausea without abdominal pain or diarrhea. her lfts were noted to be elevated with a cholestatic picture. a liver ultrasound was performed which showed unchanged biliary ductal dilatation. hepatology was consulted and they recommended a full work up given she has had elevated enzymes in the past but never had a work up to identify the source. initial hepatology labs were unrevealing including hepatitis serologies, igg, ttg, and fe levels (although she had an elevated ferretin). autoimmune antibodies, ceruloplasmin, and alpha 1 antitrypsin were pending at the time of discharge. hepatology also considered an mrcp and liver biopsy but these were not performed because her labs trended back down. it was thought that they may have transiently been elevated because of her chf exacerbation. nevertheless, she was set up with an appointment with the liver doctors to follow up on the rest of her labs and discuss the utility of a liver biopsy in the future as she may still have an underlying liver problem contributing to her acute elevation in enzymes given her history of elevated enzymes in the past. #) depression: the patient was continued on her home regimen of citalopram #) diabetes, type 2 uncontrolled: the patient was continued on glargine 54 u q hs with humalog sliding scale. her blood glucose was noted to be elevated despite her not taking in much po due to nausea. [**last name (un) **] was consulted and they recommended increasing her sliding scale. blood cultures were obtained to rule out infection but were negative. #) cad, native: the patient was continued on her metoprolol, aspirin, simvastatin, and valsartan #) dchf: echo performed showed ef 50-55%. bnp was elevated. the patient was aggresively diuresed. she was maintained on her valsartan and metoprolol. she was euvolemic at the time of discharge. #) pain control: the patient was continued on her home regimen of vicodin and gabapentin #) dispo: the patient lives at home and has vna once a month (per pt). although the patient enjoys her indiependence, it was thought that she would benefit from more assistance with monitoring, medication compliance, foley, and trach care. she was discharged with home services with vna who may determine if she required more care. . #) fen: the patient was placed on a p.o. diabetic, cardiac healthy diet . #) code status: full medications on admission: acetylcysteine 1 nebulizer treatment twice a day albuterol sulfate - 2.5 mg/3 ml (0.083 %) 1-2 puffs po twice a day benztropine mesylate - 1mg tablet three times a day butalbital-acetaminophen-caff [fioricet] - 50 mg-325 mg-40 mg tablet - 1 tablet(s) by mouth q4hr citalopram - 40 mg tablet once a day clopidogrel [plavix] 75 mg tablet once a day fluticasone-salmeterol [advair diskus] - 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose disk with device - 1 puff po twice a day furosemide - 60 mg tablet once a day gabapentin [neurontin] - 300 mg capsule po three times a day insulin glargine [lantus] 54u at bedtime insulin lispro [humalog] dosage uncertain ipratropium bromide - 0.2 mg/ml (0.02 %) 2 puffs po q6hr lorazepam - 2 mg tablet -po at bedtime as needed for insomnia may take additional one tab qam for anxiety metoclopramide - 60 mg tablet qd as directed--2 pills-1 pill-2 pills and 1 pill metoprolol tartrate - 50 mg tablet [**hospital1 **] normal saline - - to clean tracheotomy [**hospital1 **] and prn omeprazole - 20 mg capsule, delayed release(e.c.) - [**hospital1 **] ondansetron - 8 mg tablet, rapid dissolve [**hospital1 **] prn for nausea pnv w/o calcium-iron fum-fa [m-vit] 27 mg-1 mg tabletbid simvastatin - 20 mg tablet po qday valsartan [diovan] - 40 mg tablet po qday vicodin - 5-500mg tablet - 1-2 tabs po tid, prn for back and knee pains aspirin - 325 mg tablet po qday calcium carbonate [tums ultra] - 1,000 mg tablet, docusate calcium - 100mg capsule - po bid discharge medications: 1. acetylcysteine 20 % (200 mg/ml) solution [**hospital1 **]: one (1) ml miscellaneous [**hospital1 **] (2 times a day). 2. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 ml (0.083 %) solution for nebulization [**hospital1 **]: 1-2 puffs inhalation twice a day. 3. benztropine 1 mg tablet [**hospital1 **]: one (1) tablet po three times a day. 4. fioricet 50-325-40 mg tablet [**hospital1 **]: one (1) tablet po every four (4) hours. 5. citalopram 20 mg tablet [**hospital1 **]: two (2) tablet po daily (daily). 6. clopidogrel 75 mg tablet [**hospital1 **]: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 7. advair diskus 250-50 mcg/dose disk with device [**hospital1 **]: one (1) puff inhalation twice a day. 8. furosemide 20 mg tablet [**hospital1 **]: three (3) tablet po once a day. 9. neurontin 300 mg capsule [**hospital1 **]: one (1) capsule po three times a day. 10. insulin glargine 100 unit/ml solution [**hospital1 **]: fifty four (54) units subcutaneous at bedtime. 11. insulin lispro subcutaneous 12. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % solution [**hospital1 **]: two (2) puffs inhalation qid (4 times a day). 13. lorazepam 1 mg tablet [**hospital1 **]: two (2) tablet po at bedtime as needed for insomnia: may take additional tab qam for anxiety. 14. metoclopramide oral 15. metoprolol tartrate 50 mg tablet [**hospital1 **]: one (1) tablet po bid (2 times a day). 16. normal saline flush 0.9 % syringe [**hospital1 **]: one (1) trach flush injection twice a day: prn to clean tracheotomy. 17. omeprazole 20 mg capsule, delayed release(e.c.)

[**2113-1-17**]: limited abdomen ultrasound: there is a tiny amount of fluid adjacent to the liver. there are no loculated fluid collections. brief hospital course: 89 year-old male with mmp including cad, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and recent admission to osh with enterococcus fecalis uti and bacteremia, complicated by presumed enteroccus endocarditis (negative tee but recurrent positive blood cultures and ongoing fever), treated with ampicillin iv (1 gm iv q 6 hours) and gentamicin iv (started on [**2113-1-5**]), now admitted with fever, hypotension and respiratory symptoms. his hospital course will be reviewed by problems. 1) hypotension/fever: given the hypotension in the setting of recurrent fever and recent enterococcal bacteremia, the most likely etiology was felt to be septic shock +/- cardiogenic component. a bedside echo on admission showed relatively preserved ef, no pleural effusion. it was unclear whether his fever/hypotension were related to persistent enterococcal infection or a new nosocomial infection. cxr was without pna and u/a clear. cultures sent. given concern over potential line infection, picc line was d/c'd on admission. the antibiotic regimen was changed to vancomycin iv and gentamycin iv for rx of enterococcus +/ line infection. the patient was quickly weaned off dopamine in the icu, and was transferred to the floor on [**2113-1-15**]. all cultures at [**hospital1 18**] were unremarkable. however, mr. [**known lastname **] continued to spike fever up to 102.3 on vancomycin and gentamicin. a repeat tee was performed on [**2113-1-16**], which revealed normal lvef 60-65%, and no vegetation although a sessile vegetation could not be ruled out given severe calcification of aortic valve. probable moderate as, trace ar, moderate to severe mr (mild mr in [**2111**]), moderate tr. an abdominal u/s was also performed, which revealed a small amount of ascites and no fluid collection. id was consulted. given his respiratory symptoms, levofloxacin 500 mg po qd was added to cover for pulmonary organisms. a nasal wash was also sent to rule out influenza, which came back positive for influenza a. in retrospect, his acute presentation was felt likely secondary to influenza. given the duration of his symptoms and clinical improvement, decision was taken not to treat. he was kept on droplet precautions in hospital (d/c'd on [**2113-1-24**]). levofloxacin d/c'd on [**2113-1-20**]. respiratory symptoms resolved at the time of discharge. intermittent wheezing in hospital, kept on albuterol and ipratropium nebs prn. of note, sensitivities were repeated on the osh isolate and ampicillin sensitivity was confirmed, mic <=2. antibiotics were changed back to ampicillin 1 gm iv q 6 hours, and gentamicin 80 mg iv q 48 hours (dose adjusted according to levels and creatinine) on [**2113-1-20**]. ampicillin increased to 2 gm iv q 8 hours on [**2113-1-23**] after discussion with id team. plan is to complete 6 weeks of therapy with ampicillin and gentamicin (last doses on [**2113-2-16**]). picc line in place. will need gentamicin levels every 4th day (goal peak=3, trough=1). hold gentamicin if creatinine >2.5. 2) chf: lasix and spironolactone were held on admission given hypotension, restarted on [**2113-1-15**]. cxrs in hospital revealed progressive fluid overload, and lasix dose was titrated up to maintain negative fluid balance. per patient's wife, out-patient lasix dose is 160 mg po qam and 120 mg po qpm. on lasix 80 mg po bid at discharge, with goal to titrate to even to negative fluid balance as an out-patient. [**date range **] weight 140lbs. low threshold to increase lasix if increasing edema on exam, or >=3lbs weight gain as creatinine tolerates. 3) cad: troponin 0.09 (peak) on admission, felt likely troponin leak in the setting of infection and renal failure. ekg without acute ischemic changes. in hospital, he was continued on metoprolol and asa. history of adverse reaction to ace. also continued on zetia for hyperlipidemia. 4) atrial fibrillation: metoprolol initially held in the setting of hypotension, restarted as bp tolerated. good rate control on 25 mg po bid. patient also continued on coumadin, with goal inr [**2-16**]. coumadin dose decreased to 1 mg po qhs given elevated inr in hospital (out-patient dose 2mg po qhs). inr 2.0 will need close monitoring at rehab. 5) diabetes mellitus type 2: poor glycemic control in hospital. prandin was held, and he was started on glargine at night, titrated up to 9 units qhs, along with riss, with plan to manage on glargine as an out-patient. patient will need teaching at rehab center. would not restart prandin. 6) mds with pancytopenia: per patient's pcp, [**name10 (nameis) 5348**] hct around 32-33. while in hospital, patient transfused a total of 3 units of prbcs to maintain hct >30 given known cad. platelets stable in low 100k, and wbc around [**name10 (nameis) 5348**] of 3. 7) chronic renal insufficiency: creatinine around [**name10 (nameis) 5348**] of 2 in hospital, slightly higher on [**2113-1-23**] at 2.2. gentamicin levels monitored carefully in hospital given risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. patient will need gentamicin levels q 4 days, with goal peak=3 and trough=1. plan to d/c gentamicin if creatinine >=2.5. 8) cryptogenic cirrhosis: patient continued on spironolactone and lactulose in hospital. of note, patient noted to have mild elevation of alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and ggt in hospital, also elevated at osh. abdominal u/s at osh negative for cbd dilatation, no gb wall thickening, no pericholecystic fluid. no acute issues in hospital. 9) prophylaxis: on coumadin, protonix (history of pud) and bowel regimen in hospital. code: dnr/dni per discussion with patient and family. medications on admission: meds on transfer from micu: coumadin 2 mg po qd lasix 80 mg iv qd spironolactone 25 mg po qd gentamicin 120 mg iv qd (d2) lacutlose 30 mg po tid vancomycin 1 g iv qd (d2) dulcolax 10 mg po/pr prn senna prn atrovent neb q 6h albuterol neb q 6h prn asa 325 mg po qd zetia 10 mg po qd colace 100 mg po bid folate 1 mg po qd mvi 1 po qd protonix 40 mg po qd celexa 10 mg po qd riss tylenol prn discharge medications: 1. acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets po q4-6h (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed. 2. citalopram hydrobromide 20 mg tablet sig: 0.5 tablet po daily (daily). 3. pantoprazole sodium 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one (1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po q24h (every 24 hours). 4. multivitamin capsule sig: one (1) cap po daily (daily). 5. folic acid 1 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 6. docusate sodium 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po bid (2 times a day). 7. ezetimibe 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 8. aspirin 325 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 9. albuterol sulfate 0.083 % solution sig: one (1) neb inhalation q6hrs: prn as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing. 10. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % solution sig: one (1) neb inhalation q6hrs: prn as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing. 11. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2 times a day) as needed. 12. bisacodyl 5 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: two (2) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po daily (daily) as needed. 13. spironolactone 25 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 14. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2 times a day). 15. lactulose 10 g/15 ml syrup sig: thirty (30) ml po tid (3 times a day): titrate to 2 bm per day. 16. warfarin sodium 1 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po hs (at bedtime): please monitor daily inr until stable. 17. furosemide 80 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2 times a day): please monitor daily weight. . 18. gentamicin in normal saline 80 mg/50 ml piggyback sig: eighty (80) mg intravenous q48h (every 48 hours): please hold dose on [**2113-1-24**].check daily creatinine;

[**known lastname 31866**] was initially symptom free from a pulmonary standpoint. however, on the day after admission, she began to have hypoxic episodes with saturations down to 80%. cxr on admission was clear, repeat cxr showed possible rll pneumonia. she was started on ceftriaxone. on day 5 of admission she was briefly transferred to the icu due to sustained hypoxia (assocaited with chest pain, ce's negative). at the time she was on a nrb, with saturations of 93%. abg on nrb was 7.40/31/64. she was treated briefly with vanc/zosyn, however was quickly switched back to ceftriaxone with azithromycin to complete 10 day course for hcap. clindamycin was added out of concern for aspiration. she was febrile when antibiotics were discontinued, but she had no sign of active infection on exam or lab test. repeat cxr after antibiotic course showed resolution of rll pna, but edema was still present. due to continued hypoxia despite successful diuresis, a repeat ct of her chest was performed which showed ground glass opacities in the periphery of all lung fields bilaterally. initially, the concern was for infectious vs embolic etiology for these ground glass opacities, however pulmonary consult was less concerned and no intervention was made. # crf: her was cr 2.6 initially, but quickly returned to her baseline. she was given lasix when diuresis was initially attempted, but this gave pt pruritis which resolved with benedryl. due to fluid overload and the adverse reaction to lasix, mrs. [**known lastname 31866**] was diuresed with ethacrynic acid during the second week of her admission. she was treated with benadryl prn for itching with the ethacrynic as well. renal function was at baseline (cr 1.9) at discharge. # pancytopenia: hematology was consulted for her pancytopenia (wbc 3.7, hgb 9.7, plt 74k) and reviewed a peripheral blood smear. no schistocytes were seen, so this was felt unlikely to be ttp. her outpatient pentoxyfilline was discontinued due to her pancytopenia. no intervention made and her thrombocytopenia resolved. she remained anemic, not requiring transfusion. her leukopenia resolved by discharge. an outpatient f/u appt was scheduled with heme/onc. # htn: mrs.[**known lastname 31867**] hypertension was monitored in the hospital throughout her stay. she was initially hypotensive in the ed, but this responded to ivf. her b-blocker and isosorbide were continued but her doses were uptitrated. her lisinopril was decreased and her amlodipine and hctz were discontinued. her blood pressure was stable and in target range on discharge. # pulmonary nodule: on her ct scan, a 5 mm perifissural nodule versus small amount of loculated fluid was described. a followup chest ct in six months was recommended. # left groin pseudoaneurysm: she had lenis performed to rule out dvt during her hospitalization and these were without any evidence of dvt but did show a left groin pseudoaneurysm, 1.7 x 2.1 x 2.0 cm. this was felt to be stable from her previous imaging and she was advised to follow up with vascular as an outpatient. # code: dni medications on admission: aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. lorazepan 0.5mg po qhs prn pravastatin 40mg po qday hydrochlorothiazine 25mg po qday lisinopril 10mg po qday ranitidine 150mg po bid citalopram 40mg po qday amlodipine 10mg po qday isosorbdin 40 mg er qday allopurinol 100mg po qday cipro 500mg po bid x 4 doses-stoped on saturday discharge medications: 1. nitroglycerin 0.3 mg tablet, sublingual sig: one (1) tablet, sublingual sublingual prn (as needed) as needed for chest pain : take one, if no resolution of chest pain after 5 minutes take another pill. if after 2nd pill no resolution of chest pain call 911. disp:*30 tablet, sublingual(s)* refills:*0* 2. aspirin 325 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). disp:*30 tablet(s)* refills:*0* 3. citalopram 20 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily (daily) for 1 months. disp:*60 tablet(s)* refills:*0* 4. lorazepam 1 mg tablet sig: .5 tablet po hs (at bedtime) as needed for sleep. 5. isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg tablet sustained release 24 hr sig: three (3) tablet sustained release 24 hr po qhs (once a day (at bedtime)). disp:*90 tablet sustained release 24 hr(s)* refills:*0* 6. lisinopril 5 mg tablet sig: 0.5 tablet po daily (daily). disp:*15 tablet(s)* refills:*0* 7. pravastatin 80 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once a day. disp:*30 tablet(s)* refills:*0* 8. metoprolol tartrate 50 mg tablet sig: 1.5 tablets po three times a day. disp:*135 tablet(s)* refills:*0* 9. omeprazole 40 mg capsule, delayed release(e.c.) sig: one (1) capsule, delayed release(e.c.) po once a day. disp:*30 capsule, delayed release(e.c.)(s)* refills:*0* 10. pentoxifylline 400 mg tablet sustained release sig: one (1) tablet sustained release po three times a day. 11. ranitidine hcl 150 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po twice a day. discharge disposition: home with service facility: [**company **] discharge diagnosis: primary: 1. urinary tract infection 2. pneumonia 3. diastolic heart failure secondary: 1. coronary artery disease 2. hypertension 3. gerd discharge condition: vital signs stable, satting 93% on ra, ambulating without assistance discharge instructions: you were admitted to the [**hospital1 18**] for fever and an urinary infection after having nausea and vomiting at home from taking cipro. you continued to have fever during your hospitalization, we found that you had pneumonia and treated you with antibiotics. you also had episodes of chest pain and decreases in your oxygen. in consultation with the cardiologist, we concluded that you were not having a heart attack, however you will need close follow-up with your cardiologist and pcp.

[**first name (stitle) **] anesthesia: general. indication: this gentleman has had multiple operations for problems of myeloma decline. most recently, he had an omental graft which was harvested from the intra-abdominal cavity, brought out through a flank wound and into an open wound of the back. this was several years ago and allowed this would to heal. unfortunately, he has developed a hernia in this area. he presents now for repair. the hernia itself was large and bothersome but, more importantly, it is very large and contains a fair amount of small and large intestine, through a relatively [**name2 (ni) 15403**] defect. this does place him at risk for incarceration or strangulation. preparation: in the operating room, the patient was given general endotracheal anesthetic. intravenous antibiotics were given. catheter was placed into the bladder. the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, prepared with betadine solution and draped in the usual fashion. incision: the incision was opened along the inferior aspect of one of the v-y advancement incisions and carried down to the subcutaneous tissue. findings: there was quite a large hernia sac. the defect itself was [**name2 (ni) 15403**] in size. one portion of the defect was the anterior superior iliac spine. the omental graft went through this defect. procedure in detail: the sac was dissected away from the surrounding tissue. we were then able to find the omental graft and dissect the surrounding tissues away from the edge of the fascial defect and bone defect. we took care to stay in a relatively extraperitoneal plane here and there was certainly adequate amount of coverage of the bowel and its contents with peritoneum such that we could use normal graft material. the omental graft was then divided and a section of it was removed. we thought that this would be perfectly reasonable as the defect could not be closed without removing it without a high-risk of recurrence and also that the tissue had already experienced inset for the past several years and was vascularized with surrounding focal vasculature. therefore, the graft was divided with clamps and ties of 2-0 vicryl. the defect was then measured and we placed a marlex patch as an underlay with a lot of underlay, measuring at least 3 to 5 cm underneath the fascial edges. we began the most anterior part and ran these around with running full- thickness mattress sutures. the repair was done under some tension in order to have the edges come together nicely which, indeed, they did. the tension was not excessive and came together very well. we then finished the closure by placing 4 mitek anchors into the bone. these were attached to number one sutures which were then sutured to the vasculature to close off that portion of the defect. the area was then inspected for hemostasis which was quite adequate. closure: the sac tissue was closed over the top of this in order to exclude it from the wound and also to decrease seroma formation. this was done with running suture of #2-0 pds. the subcutaneous tissue was closed with interrupted sutures of 2-0 vicryl. dermal sutures of 3-0 vicryl were then placed and a running subcuticular suture of 4-0 monocryl was then placed to close the skin. a dry sterile dressing was then applied. the patient was then extubated and sent to the recovery area in satisfactory condition, having tolerated the procedure well. drains: none. complications: none. estimated blood loss: minimal.

back from his previous omental flap and resections. the previous incision was incised and extended proximally slightly about 4 cm. this was taken down to known tissue and what was thought to be the l2 spinous process based on his ct scan. the paraspinal muscles were dissected off the l2 spinous process. the omental flap was incised and was found to be well perfused. the lamina of l2 as well as the l2-3 facet was identified. the partial l3 spinous process was then dissected and soft tissue was stripped from that. the bony anatomy in either gutter was identified down to what was thought to be l5. a lateral radiograph confirmed the levels. at that point an l3 laminectomy was performed as well as l2-l3 decompression. the l3 pedicles were well visualized. the l2- l3 foramen was felt and felt to be open. the bilateral l3 pedicles were directly visualized and the l3 exiting nerve roots were visualized after freeing up the scar tissue. this was continued distally. the l4 pedicles were visualized after freeing up the scar tissue from the lateral gutters. the dural sac was freely mobile below that. the l5 pedicles were then visualized bilaterally. on the left side there appeared to be no bone laterally that could be stripped of soft tissue as was consistent with the ct scan. on the right side there was bony tissue visualized and the l5 pedicle was visualized at that point. the dural sac at that point was felt to be freely mobile without significant posterior compression. significant ligamentum flavum and hypertrophic ligamentum flavum had been removed at the l3-l4 level. the discs and ventral dural sack could be examined at the l3-4 level to some degree. below this it was felt that the risks of a dural tear were too high versus looking for a ventral lesion. hemostasis was maintained. copious irrigation was used. two drains were placed. the deep tissue was closed with interrupted #0 vicryls. the subcutaneous with #2-0 vicryls and the skin with staples. patient was placed supine and taken to the intensive care unit without complications.

at l2. 3. dural repair. instrumentation: none. anesthesia: general endotracheal. fluids: 1500 cc. estimated blood loss: 250 cc. urine output: 580 cc. drains: two medium hemovacs placed deep. specimens: 1. two specimens were sent to microbiology. 2. one specimen was sent to pathology which was deep tissue. findings: 1. large fluid collection just above the dura. 2. a dural tear that was the size of approximately a 20 gauge needle tip on the right side at the level of the inferior aspect of the l2 lamina as predicted on ct based on ct myelogram. complications: none. sponge count: correct. x-ray showing no retained hardware. indications: this is a 63 year old gentleman who i previously did a revision l2-l3 to l5-s1 decompression for cauda equina. he did quite well in the postoperative period. he regained his quad strength on his right and left side, although nothing distal to that. he was even scheduled and considered for rehabilitation placement. however, he developed mental status changes on postoperative day 6 and was intubated for fevers. he became septic. blood cultures grew out gram-negative rods. the a spiral chest ct was negative. chest x-ray was negative. ua was negative. ct of the head was also negative. meningitis was considered, although i thought it was unlikely. a lumbar puncture was positive for significant number of white cells as well as protein without glucose. gram-negative rods were also seen in the lumbar puncture. an aspiration of a fluid collection on a new ct of his lumbar spine also showed gram-negative rods. beta-2 transferrin levels were pending. on review with the radiologist, the previous ct monitoring done on [**10-16**], there is a dural leak that was not previously present. at that time, there was no posterior fluid collection. secondary to the fact that there was a fluid collection in his lumbar spine as well as gram negative rods, he was consented through his fiance for an i and d of his lumbar spine and at this point also could address the persistent dural leak. procedure: the patient was brought from the trauma intensive care unit intubated to the or. he was placed on [**initials (namepattern4) **] [**last name (namepattern4) 1661**] table, bony prominences carefully padded. the staples were removed. his lumbar wound was prepped and draped sterilely in the usual fashion. the incision was opened. all vicryl sutures were removed. this was taken down through the dura. the skin edges as well as the superficial and deep tissues from the wounds were freshened using curet, leksells, back to bleeding tissue. hemostasis was then obtained. the deep bone in the bilateral gutters were cleaned of soft tissue and previous gelfoam. copious pulse lavage was used including 9 liters of fluid after tissue resection had taken place. the dural leak was exactly where it was predicted by the radiologist which was on the right side just at the inferior surface of the l2 lamina. there was a poke hole and no other area of leakage was noted. a laminotomy was taken at l2 to fully expose the leakage. copious irrigation was used. when [**initials (namepattern4) **] [**last name (namepattern4) **] was placed on this hole, no other area of leakage could be identified. at that time, duragen was placed over this hole and then tisseel was used over the duragen. at this point, the wound was closed with interrupted 0 vicryls after medium hemovacs were placed deep to this. 2-0 vicryls were used in the subcutaneous tissue. the scar was removed and the skin was closed with horizontal mattress 2-0 nylons. cultures had been taken as well as a piece of tissue from the deep layer to pathology. xeroform was placed and a sterile dressing was placed. the patient was placed supine on a regular bed and taken back to the trauma intensive care unit. i talked specifically to the team. he is to stay flat for at least 3 days. he is to undergo dvt prophylaxis primarily with compression stockings. while the drains are in place, he is to continue on his antibiotics and maximize the nutrition.

medical floor on the second hospital day in stable condition with a decreased temperature, and no further abnormal movements. 1. neurology: a neurology consultation was obtained when the patient was first admitted given that he had fever and mental status changes. it was felt that the patient's abnormalities were most likely secondary to a medication reaction, as they promptly resolved after withdrawal of the offending agents. the question of a lumbar puncture was raised, but given the patient's lack of neurologic findings, lack of meningeal signs, and quick resolution of fever without

and alt were mildly elevated while admitted. he also described a history of a 40-pound to 50-pound weight loss over the past one to two years as well as anorexia and chronic nausea and vomiting. he did not have any stigmata of chronic liver disease on physical examination, however. given his weight loss and long-term history of hepatitis with elevated liver enzymes, there was concern for hepatoma. i spoke with the patient's primary care physician and informed her of the hepatitis serology results as well as the fact that his liver enzymes were elevated. she stated she would get the patient referred to gastroenterology. 3. infectious disease: as stated, the patient had a temperature at the time of admission after he had significant agitation and muscular rigidity secondary to his presumed drug reaction. he never had an elevated white blood cell count. he had been afebrile for more than 24 hours at the time of this discharge summary. there was concern for possible urinary tract infection, as a urine sample which had been sent while a foley was in place showed a significant amount of blood with white blood cells present. however, there were no bacteria seen, and there was a significant amount of red blood cells consistent with trauma from the foley. a repeat urinalysis was sent when the foley was removed, and this showed still blood present but no nitrites and no leukocyte esterase. there were no bacteria seen on microscopy. it was felt that his urine findings were most likely secondary to trauma from the foley and not infection. his cultures have remained negative. blood cultures have remained negative as well. stool cultures were negative for clostridium difficile, salmonella, and shigella. 4. renal: the patient did have a rise in his creatine kinase amount after having his initial episode of agitation and significant thrashing about with injury to his arms and legs when he was in the four-point restraints. his creatine kinases peaked at 8868 on the second hospital day, and on the third hospital day they were trending down. at the time of this discharge summary the most recent creatine kinase was 5569. there was another creatine kinase pending for this afternoon. if it is still trending down, the patient will be discontinued from his intravenous fluids. his renal function had remained stable with a stable blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. 5. communications: the patient's primary care physician [**last name (namepattern4) **].

monitoring status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with adverse reaction to fentanyl and tongue injury. history of present illness: the patient is a 59 year-old female status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on the day of admission, which had been done to evaluate for possible bile leak after cholecystectomy was performed four days ago. the patient was in her usual state of health until four days prior to admission when she had a cholecystectomy. her postop course was uneventful until one day prior to admission when she developed abdominal pain. she went to an outside hospital emergency room and was reassured and sent home. on the day of admission she returned to the outside hospital emergency room where an abdominal ct was performed, which showed ""thickened stomach and free air."" she was sent to [**hospital1 1444**] for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and possible stent placement. she had a successful endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which showed a bile leak at the duct of luschka. a stent was placed successfully. after her endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography the patient developed ""jaw clenching, biting tongue, rigidity and cold/chills."" the patient received ampicillin, gentamycin and flagyl empirically as well as narcan to reverse fentanyl. because of the tongue injury and tachycardia as well as possible infection given her fevers or chills the gi service transferred the patient to the micu for close observation. past medical history: 1. hiatal hernia. 2. status post cholecystectomy four days prior to admission. 3. urinary frequency secondary to interstitial cystitis. 4. mitral valve prolapse. 5. tubal ligation many years ago. medications on admission: 1. prempro. 2. eye drops. allergies: no known drug allergies at the time of admission, however, it is assumed that her rigidity and jaw clenching was secondary to fentanyl. social history: the patient is married. she works as a teacher's aid in [**location (un) 8072**]. she denies tobacco or alcohol use. physical examination on admission to the micu: vital signs temperature 100.6. heart rate 105. blood pressure 162/76. respiratory rate 18. sating 98% on 3 liters. in general, the patient was groggy status post anesthesia, shivering, but awake. heent showed tongue with laceration on the right edge. mucous membranes are moist. pupils are equal, round and reactive to light. extraocular movements intact. lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. heart regular rate and rhythm. no murmurs, rubs or gallops. abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended. there were normoactive bowel sounds. there was no rebound or guarding. there were post laparoscopic incisions without erythema with steri-strips in place. the extremities were without edema. dorsalis pedis pulses were intact bilaterally. there were no rashes. laboratories on admission: white blood cell count 9.0, hematocrit 39.3, platelets 296, neutrophil count 82, lymphocytes 14, 4 monocytes, troponin was less then 0.3. sodium 139, potassium 3.8, chloride 101, bicarb 26, bun 9, creatinine 0.7, glucose 141, albumin 4.1, calcium 8.9, ldh 665, ast 44, alt of 57, amylase 41, ck 32. electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 73 beats per minute. there was normal axis. normal intervals. there were no st or t wave changes. abdominal ct showed inflammation in the right upper quadrant, small fluid in the circumferential thickening of the distal stomach. there was a question of a small ulcer. there was a tiny amount of free air. this was per report of [**hospital3 3583**]. hospital course: in summary the patient is a 59 year-old female who was admitted to [**hospital1 188**] for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for possible stent placement for a bile leak secondary to cholecystectomy performed four days prior to admission. she then suffered rigidity with jaw clenching and tongue biting secondary to fentanyl administration and was transferred to the micu for close observation. she did well overnight in the micu. she was started on ampicillin, gentamycin and flagyl. her liver function tests and amylase and lipase were followed closely. on the second hospital day the patient was doing much better and was stable from an airway perspective, so she was transferred to the general medical floor. 1. gastrointestinal: as stated the patient was status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent placement for a bile leak from the duct of luschka. the patient was continued on ampicillin, gentamycin and flagyl, which had been started at the time of transfer to the micu. she had waxing and [**doctor last name 688**] fevers. however, her white blood cell count was never really elevated and she did not have a bandemia. on the day of transfer to the general medical floor the patient had received clear liquids. she did not tolerate this very well. her amylase and lipase on the day following the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography were elevated. amylase was 2304 with lipase being 7116. therefore she was made npo and given aggressive intravenous hydration. on the second hospital day on the general medical floor the patient had marked rebound to palpation of her abdomen. she was followed closely with serial abdominal examinations. her amylase and lipase were trending down, however. an abdominal ct was obtained, which showed only mild pancreatitis. there were no intra-abdominal fluid collections, which required any drainage. on the third hospital day the patient's pain was improving and the rebound was decreasing. her enzymes continued to trend down. she received clear liquids in the evening and tolerated these well. on the day of discharge the patient was tolerating a brat diet without significant abdominal pain. she had no further rebound. she had no temperature spikes in greater then 24 hours at the time of discharge. 2. hematology: the patient's hematocrit was 34.8 at the time of admission. it decreased to 30 in the setting of aggressive hydration. it remained stable at the time of discharge and it was 29.5 on the day of discharge. 3. fen: the patient was aggressively hydrated given that she was npo. she required periodic repletion of her potassium. her bicarb began to drop and she developed an anion gap acidosis. this was most likely secondary to ketoacidosis as she had no dextrose in her intravenous fluids. this was added on the evening prior to discharge and on the day of discharge her anion gap acidosis had resolved. condition on discharge: stable. medications on discharge: 1. levaquin 500 mg one po q day times seven days. 2. protonix 40 mg po q day. 3. percocet one to two tablets po q 4 to 6 hours prn. the patient was given a prescription for ten pills. 4. prempro as the patient was formerly taking. 5. trazodone at bedtime. discharge follow up: the patient was to make an appointment with dr. [**last name (stitle) **] within one to two months after discharge for removal of the stent. in addition, she would follow up with her primary care physician within one to two weeks following discharge. she was to continue on a brat diet over the weekend and two days after discharge she could advance to a low fat no dairy diet. she could slowly advance back to a normal diet over the next week. discharge diagnoses: 1. post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis. 2. anemia. 3. hypokalemia. 4. anion gap acidosis. 5. bile leak.

52,"admission date: [**2105-11-22**] discharge date: [**2105-11-25**] service: ccu chief complaint: inferior st-elevation myocardial infarction. history of present illness: the patient is a 78-year-old male with no prior cardiac history who described atypical neck and arm pain over the preceding two to three months prior to admission while playing golf. he had been told by his orthopaedic surgeon that he had arthritis; however, the character of the pain changed over the past two weeks to include substernal pressure and pain with exertion which was relieved with rest. he presented to [**hospital3 **] twice over the past two weeks. he had electrocardiograms done, enzymes, and chest x-rays and told that his pain was likely not cardiac. his primary care physician thought that his pain was musculoskeletal and prescribed ibuprofen. on the night prior to admission, at around 11 p.m., the patient experienced sudden [**9-1**] to [**10-1**] substernal chest pain radiating to the arms and neck. not associated with any nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis. he went to [**hospital3 38285**] where electrocardiogram showed initially 1-mm st elevations in ii, ii, and avf and st depressions in v1 through v3. he was given sublingual nitroglycerin times three, morphine, and given 10 units of retavase times two (30 minutes apart). subsequent electrocardiograms showed worsening st elevations up to 2 mm to 3 mm inferiorly with reciprocal 3-mm to 4-mm st depressions in v1 through v4. the patient was started in a heparin drip and was pain free at the time of transfer to [**hospital1 69**]. past medical history: 1. hypertension. 2. anxiety/panic attacks. 3. hiatal hernia. 4. irritable bowel syndrome. 5. gastroesophageal reflux disease. 6. glaucoma. allergies: tetracycline (causes swelling of the tongue) and timoptic and other beta blocker medications (which have led to respiratory difficulty). medications on admission: 1. ibuprofen p.o. as needed. 2. bentyl. 3. librium 10 mg p.o. q.d. as needed. 4. rescula eyedrops one drop both eyes b.i.d. 5. cardizem-cd 240 mg p.o. q.d. 6. zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. 7. aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. 8. glucosamine chondroitin. 9. multivitamin. medications on transfer: additional medications at the time of transfer included nitroglycerin drip and a heparin drip. social history: the patient has about a 30-pack-year smoking history, though he quit in [**2062**]. currently, he smokes approximately two cigars per day (which he quit this winter). he drinks alcohol only occasionally. he used to work as a motion picture projectionist. he is now retired and works at a golf course. physical examination on presentation: physical examination on admission revealed he was a very pleasant, in no acute distress. he had no jugular venous distention. his lung was clear to auscultation bilaterally. his heart examination had a normal first heart sound and second heart sound without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. he had no peripheral edema and 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses. radiology/imaging: electrocardiogram on admission to the coronary care unit showed a sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute with a leftward axis. normal intervals and upward cove st segments inferiorly with resolution of the st elevations and only slight residual st depressions in v3 and v4. pertinent laboratory data on presentation: laboratories on admission were remarkable for a creatine kinase of 2768 with a mb fraction of 158. laboratories from the outside hospital showed a mb of 7.9 and a troponin of 5.1. complete blood count and chemistry-10 were all within normal limits. coagulations revealed ptt was 100.8. hospital course: 1. cardiovascular system: (a) coronary artery disease: as the patient was pain free on admission to the coronary care unit, there was no indication for emergent catheterization. he was continued on aspirin, heparin drip, and a nitroglycerin drip. because of the patient's adverse reaction in the past to beta blockers, there was concern in initiating this medication. the patient was initially given a test dose of esmolol at 50 mcg/kg per minute to control his heart rate which was elevated in the 90s. the patient tolerated the esmolol very well, and the following morning was changed to oral lopressor at 12.5 mg b.i.d. on the morning of admission, the patient was also loaded on plavix at 300 mg with the dose then changed to 75 mg p.o. q.d. thereafter. he was also started on integrilin that evening in preparation for a catheterization the next day. his creatine kinases were cycled and showed that his peak creatine kinase was 2768; the value on admission. on [**2105-11-23**], the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant system. there was a 90% proximal left circumflex stenosis, 70% medial left circumflex stenosis, and 70% first obtuse marginal stenosis. there was also a long 80% medial right coronary artery lesion. the proximal circumflex lesion was stented times two; the second stent being placed distally because of dissection. the distal circumflex stent was stented as well as was the medial right coronary artery stenosis. the patient tolerated the procedure well, and after the catheterization laboratory went to the general medicine floor. his beta blocker had been titrated up to a dose as high as 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., at which time the patient began to develop some respiratory complaints including shortness of breath, the feeling of tightness in his chest, and a cough. his lopressor was held initially, and the beta blocking effects were reversed with an albuterol inhaler; to which the patient responded to very well; however, his cough persisted. due to the possibility that his cough could have been induced by captopril which the patient had been started on, captopril was stopped, and he was changed to an angiotensin receptor blocker (cozaar) on which he was to be discharged. (b) pump: the patient was started initially on captopril and titrated as his blood pressure allowed. because his blood pressures remained in the 80s to 90s systolic, he was continued on only 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d. as stated above, because of the cough, the patient's captopril was stopped and he was changed to cozaar on the day of discharge. (c) rhythm: as the patient did not tolerate a beta blocker, it was discontinued. the patient was to be restarted on his outpatient dose of cardizem 240 mg p.o. q.d. he was in sinus rhythm throughout his admission. 2. pulmonary system: on hospital day three, the patient developed respiratory complaints thought to be due to his beta blocker medications (as stated above). the beta blocker was reversed with an albuterol inhaler, to which he responded to very well, and his symptoms resolved short of a mild dry cough; felt likely to be due to the captopril. 3. anxiety: the patient was treated with librium as needed. discharge status: the patient was discharged to home. following a physical therapy evaluation, he was deemed safe to return home. medications on discharge: 1. cozaar 25 mg p.o. q.d. 2. aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. 3. plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. 4. cardizem-cd 240 mg p.o. q.d. 5. rescula eyedrops one drop both eyes b.i.d. 6. zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. 7. librium 10 mg p.o. q.d. as needed (for anxiety). 8. ibuprofen p.o. as needed. 9. bentyl p.o. as needed 10. glucosamine chondroitin (as taken prior to admission). discharge diagnoses: acute myocardial infarction. discharge instructions/followup: the patient was to follow up with his primary care physician (dr.

patient has been noted to have significant htn, with sbps in the low 200s associated with mild ha. it is not clear what her pre-admission bp regimen was, though outpatient notes indicate lisinopril alone (?dose). she was begun on captopril -> lisinopril 20mg, hctz 25, and metoprolol, with improved control. a renal aretry u/s was obtained today for workup of ?secondary htn. past medical history: asthma htn knee oa s/p r knee arthroscopy in [**10-27**] obesity colon resection social history: [**date range 8003**]-speaking only. lives 1 hour from [**location (un) 86**] in a 2 floor home. eight children no tobacco no alcohol no illicit drug use. unable to exercise. physical [**location (un) **]: gen: patient appears stated age, found sitting up in bed, in nad heent: sclera anicteric, conjunctiva uninjected, perl, eomi, mmm, no sores in op, no evidence of thrush neck: no jvd, no lad, nl rom cor: rrr nl s1 s2 ii/vi hsm at apex chest: inspiratory, bibasilar crackles r>l. abd: soft, obese, nt/nd, +bs. no hsm appreciated. ext: no calf tenderness. no edema. 2+dp/pt pulses. r knee sutures intact, and knee is without evidence of inflammation (no fluctuance, warmth, or tenderness to palpation) neuro: ms [**first name (titles) **] [**last name (titles) **], cn ii-xii in tact, ue/le strength 5+ bilaterally, nl cerebellar [**last name (titles) **]. gait not tested. pertinent results: [**2161-5-6**] 03:05pm glucose-170* na+-143 k+-3.7 cl--103 tco2-28 [**2161-5-6**] 03:05pm o2-40 po2-113* pco2-59* ph-7.26* total co2-28 base xs--1 intubated-not intuba comments-cool neb [**2161-5-6**] 04:09pm type-art rates-[**4-4**] tidal vol-500 po2-424* pco2-71* ph-7.21* total co2-30 base xs--1 intubated-intubated [**2161-5-6**] 04:48pm pt-13.1 ptt-23.7 inr(pt)-1.1 [**2161-5-6**] 04:48pm plt count-145* [**2161-5-6**] 04:48pm neuts-85.2* lymphs-13.4* monos-1.0* eos-0.2 basos-0.2 [**2161-5-6**] 04:48pm wbc-8.3 rbc-4.01* hgb-12.1 hct-35.2* mcv-88 mch-30.3 mchc-34.5 rdw-12.7 [**2161-5-6**] 04:48pm calcium-8.9 phosphate-3.5 magnesium-1.7 [**2161-5-6**] 05:25pm lactate-5.8* [**2161-5-6**] 08:53pm plt count-161 [**2161-5-6**] 08:24pm type-art po2-158* pco2-39 ph-7.27* total co2-19* base xs--8 [**2161-5-6**] 08:53pm neuts-85* bands-6* lymphs-7* monos-2 eos-0 basos-0 atyps-0 metas-0 myelos-0 [**2161-5-6**] 08:53pm wbc-10.9 rbc-4.15* hgb-12.6 hct-36.7 mcv-88 mch-30.4 mchc-34.4 rdw-12.7 [**2161-5-6**] 08:53pm albumin-3.9 calcium-9.3 phosphate-2.5* magnesium-1.8 [**2161-5-6**] 08:53pm ck-mb-3 ctropnt-<0.01 [**2161-5-6**] 08:53pm alt(sgpt)-13 ast(sgot)-29 ld(ldh)-241 ck(cpk)-58 alk phos-100 amylase-88 tot bili-0.5 [**2161-5-6**] 08:57pm pt-13.6 ptt-24.5 inr(pt)-1.2 [**2161-5-6**] 09:00pm urine blood-neg nitrite-neg protein-neg glucose-1000 ketone-tr bilirubin-neg urobilngn-neg ph-5.0 leuk-neg [**2161-5-6**] 09:00pm urine color-yellow appear-clear sp [**last name (un) 155**]-1.020 [**2161-5-6**] 09:06pm lactate-11.2* [**2161-5-6**] 11:06pm lactate-10.3* k+-3.6 [**2161-5-6**] 09:06pm type-[**last name (un) **] [**2161-5-6**] 11:06pm type-art temp-35.6 rates-22/ tidal vol-500 peep-5 o2-40 po2-117* pco2-39 ph-7.31* total co2-21 base xs--6 intubated-intubated brief hospital course: 53 yo female with h/o asthma s/p elective r knee arthroscopy [**5-6**], who developed hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation [**date range (1) 59224**], now recovering well on empiric steroids and nebulizers. . respiratory failure: likely [**2-25**] asthma flare possibly from instrumentation vs. adverse medication reaction vs. aspiration. continued to do well since being successfully extubated [**2161-5-8**]. received solumedrol taper and was converted to prednisone. -rapid prednisone taper -mdis -outpatient pulmonary workup, including pfts. . lactic acidosis: resolved on hospital day 2. felt to be either [**2-25**] propofol or less likely albuterol. . cp: currently chest pain free. prior lateral t wave flattening, ?etiology given serially negative cardiac enzymes. however, it is noteworthy that the cp occurred in the setting of coffee-ground emesis, and may actually have been gi in origin. -continue empiric asa. -bp control as below -consider d/c of empiric nitrates -recommend outpatient ett if has not been previously performed by outpatient cardiologist. . htn: managed by dr.

infarction in the territory of the right pca. 2. stable appearance of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left occipital lobe, extending into the occipital [**doctor last name 534**] of the lateral ventricle. no interval increase in edema or mass effect, and no new areas of hemorrhage identified. cxr: there has been interval placement of a right picc line, with the tip overlying the distal svc. a nasogastric tube is seen within the esophagus, with the distal tube oriented cephalad above the left hemidiaphragm, apparently within a hiatal hernia. the heart and mediastinum are unchanged. once again, there is diffuse increased opacity of the right hemithorax, related to a layering right effusion. while the interstitial markings are prominent, there is no overt failure. echocardiogram [**2171-12-31**]: 1. the left atrium is moderately dilated. 2. the left ventricular cavity size is normal. regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (ef>75%). 3. the aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. there is mild aortic valve stenosis. trace aortic regurgitation is seen. 4. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 5. there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. ct chest [**2172-1-2**]: 1) moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusion, associated with atelectasis. 2) no mass in the right upper lobe. 3) two noncalcified pulmonary nodules measuring 3 mm in diameter in the right upper lobe. please follow in one year if this patient has no history of malignancy, and please follow in three months if this patient has history of malignancy. 4) large hiatal hernia associated with 2-cm paraesophageal lymph node. 5) marked degenerative changes with compression fracture of the thoracic spine. brief hospital course: 1. left occipital bleed with intraventricular extension and right occipital infarction. 84 yo woman with history of hypertension who was transferred from the osh with left occipital bleed. she had right hemianopsia on initial exam and was also confused but followed simple commands. head ct day after admission showed a roughly 20cc bleed in the left occipital lobe, cortical, round appearing, with some interventricular extension, no hydrocephalus. the patient was loaded with dilantin in the ed. she was initially admitted to the intensive care unit. the patient was very hypertensive on admission. her bp was initially controlled in the icu with nipride, then switched to nicardipine. she was in the icu for several days as her blood pressure was difficult to control. eventually she was transitioned to po hctz, [**last name (un) **], labetalol and hydralazine. hctz was later stopped because of hyponatremia. glycemic control was maintained with riss. she was transferred out of the icu to neurology service on [**2171-12-27**]. the patient had been intermittently very agitated and aggressive which delayed mri/mra planned for work up of her occipital bleed. on [**2171-12-29**] she developed mental status changes, became more somnolent, lethargic. non-contrast head ct was obtained which now showed new infarction in the right occipital lobe. mri/mra were done and were unrevealing for potential cause of the patient's bilateral occipital events. the etiology of her bleed felt most likely to be a hemorrhagic transformation of an occipital infarct, although extension of hemorrhage into the ventricle is difficult to explain in this setting. other possibilities for occipital hemorrhage in this patient are amyloid angiopathy and less likely htn. mri/mra were negative for mass or aneurysm. the patient has atrial fibrillation (was not on anticoagulation) which is a potential source of thromboembolism to the brain. transthoracic echo was also checked and did not show thrombi or vegetations. at the time of discharge the patient could see some movements and larger objects. she was oriented to self and place. she followed simple commands but her mental status was not improved enough for safe self feeding. she had g-j tube placed on [**2172-1-3**] by interventional radiology. prior to discharge, she was tolerating tube feeds without difficulty. she will need to have her gastric tube changed in 3 months. 2. confusion, likely secondary to the occipital lobe bleed vs. uti. the patient was given a banana bag on admission. tsh was checked and was normal. rpr was non-reactive. folate >20. b12 was borderline low, and the patient was started on supplements. lfts were normal. 3. seizure-like activity. on evening of admission ([**12-24**]), the patient had seizure like activity with tonic arm posturing and eye gaze. dilantin level was checked and was therapeutic. seizure activity may have been due to the cortical bleed, or may have been secondary to hypokalemia (k 2.9). dilantin was continued and ms. [**known lastname 58814**] required reloading to keep dilantin level closer to therapeutic range. she was continued on dilantin until peg tube placement. dilantin was stopped prior to discharge. 4. leukocytosis. the patient's wbc peaked at 20k on [**2172-10-28**]. she remained afebrile throughout her hospitalization. she was started on levaquin on [**12-24**] for uti diagnosed at the outside hospital. chest x-ray on [**2171-12-29**] showed new retrocardiac opacity suggestive of atelectasis or new infiltrate or effusion. flagyl was added on [**2171-12-29**] given rising wbc to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia. the patient was maintained on aspiration precautions. the patient did not have sputum to send for culture. bilateral effusions were noted on cxr and chest ct. the patient had no diarrhea and her abdominal exam was benign. c. diff toxin was negative. the patient's wbc started to trend down on [**2172-10-29**]. the patient completed a course of levaquin and flagyl. crp and esr were checked because of concern for persistent leukocytosis and came back at 110 and 18.7, respectively. however, given recent cerebral infarct, hemorrhage, g/j tube placement and recent infection. breast exam was done and was negative. she had no lad. leukocytosis was attributed to recent infection. the patient will need outpatient follow up to ensure that she is up to date on all age appropriate cancer screening. the patient or family did not know the contact information or spelling of the pcp's last name ? dr. [**last name (stitle) 58815**]. 5. anemia, normocytic. hct dropped from 35 to 29, but remained stable at around 30. then it dropped again from 29 to 25 and the patient was transfused one unit of prbcs. there was no localizing source of bleeding and decrease in hct was attributed to dilutional effect. hemolysis labs were negative. reticulocyte count 2.4%. iron studies (pre-transfusion) were checked and reveled low normal serum iron, elevated ferritin and slightly low tibc. the above picture is most c/w anemia of chronic disease but would recommend rechecking when the patient is over acute illness. the patient needs to have complete work up for amenia as an outpatient. serum and urine protein electrophoresis was sent and the results were still pending at the time of discharge. b12 level was borderline low thus the patient was given b12 in the hospital. 6. hypertension. patient's blood pressure was difficult to control. her medications were adjusted. on [**1-2**] the patient had a hypertensive episode with sbp in 250's while she was in interventional radiology for peg tube placement due to missed doses of po meds. her mental exam after this episode was unchanged. stat head ct was obtained and showed on changes. ekg was also unchanged. her systolic blood pressures have been in 130's on the day of discharge on irbesartan, labetalol, and hydralazine. 7. renal insufficiency. baseline cr is unknown. fe na calculated to be 0.1% which is consistent with prerenal failure. she was rehydrated gently with ns at 80cc/hr. her cr stayed between 0.9 and 1.5. 8. atrial fibrillation. original ekg showed afib. the patient was monitored on telemetry and would go in/out of afib. she was not anticoagulated initially given acute intracranial hemorrhage. she was rate controlled on labetalol with hr in 60's. head ct on [**2172-1-2**] showed no new hemorrhage or progression of existing hemorrhage. the patient was started on coumadin on [**2172-1-6**]. goal inr [**12-19**]. her coumadin level needs to be monitored and coumadin dose adjusted. 9. hyponatremia. the patient's na went down to 128. this felt to be likely secondary to hctz as work up was c/w renal wasting. hctz was stopped. serum osm 285. urine osm 485. urine na (on hctz) was 47. fena 1%. the patient was started on standing lasix prior to discharge and her electrolytes need to be carefully monitored. 10. urethral nodule. this was noted by nursing staff during foley catheter change. the 1 cm smooth pink/purple pedunculated nodule inside urethra did not appear infected but was tender. urology were consulted for management recommendations. they did not feel that immediate intervention was necessary and recommended outpatient follow up which was arranged. 11. pulmonary nodules. chest ct was done for evaluation of the nodule that was seen on chest x-ray. this was not confirmed on chest ct and felt to be an artery or artifact. final chest ct results showed two 3 mm rul nodules, paraesophageal lymph node, pulmonary effusions, and vertebral compression fracture. pulmonary nodules seen on chest ct will need to be followed up with repeat chest ct to evaluate for interval changes. 12. volume overload. the patient developed anasarca and total body volume overload likely secondary to retention due to poor nutritional status, diastolic dysfunction, and possible as an adverse reaction to medications causing water retention. she was started on lasix prior to discharge with the goal of negative 1 liter volume balance a day. she will need daily weights and frequent reassessment of her volume status. 13. fen: the swallowing evaluation was attempted, however, the patient was confused and not cooperative. ngt was placed and tf started. peg tube was placed on [**1-3**] for nutrition because the patient's mental status and cooperation remained poor to allow for independent feeding. she was tolerating tube feedings well. 14. prophylaxis: ppi, pneumoboots, sc heparin, bowel regimen. 15. full code medications on admission: 1. hctz/lisinopril 20/25 2. hctz/irbesartan 12.5/300 3. doxepin 50mg daily 4. paxil 20 mg daily discharge disposition: extended care facility: [**hospital

[**known lastname 23081**] was transferred to the icu for close monitoring (being transferred back to the floor subsequently) most likely positional as patient's o2 saturations apparently rose quickly after sitting up. cta was negative for pe. she had no evidence of chf on cxr or exam. tte showed probable diastolic dysfunction but preserved ef. on [**2176-12-15**], she desaturated to 80%'s and had to be put on a non-rebreather briefly. oxygen saturations remained in high 90%'s on room air for remainder of hospital stay. a bubble study was performed. atrial septal defect bubble study was consistent with atrial septal defect but it was felt that her stroke was more likely attributable to vertebral disease than paradoxical emboli. cardiology thought that this was a possible underlying cause of desaturation, but felt that this was unlikely given the paroxysmal nature of her desaturations that were more frequent during sleep. this will need to be followed in rehabilitation, but as an inpatient, such events did not occur later in the admission. dr. [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**last name (namepattern1) **], who saw her during this admission, will see her as an outpatient for further evaluation. again, we do not attribute her stroke to this defect. thyroid nodule of note, cta also revealed a small low density right thyroid nodule measuring about 8 mm. she should get tft's prior to ultrasound and this should be followed as an outpatient. hypertension pt remained hypertensive, reaching systolic 200's. per neuro, bp was allowed to autoregulate with goal bp 140-180 systolic. she was controlled with hydralazine for sbp above 180's. lisinopril was restarted at 5 mg, resulting in improved control. blood pressure is best lowered gradually in this context, with uptitration of acei most desirable. chest pain in the icu, she had episodes of chest pain often precipitated by food intake. ekg remained unchanged from prior. cardiac enzymes were negative. she was put on a nitro gtt at one point as she was hypertensive to systolic 190's. she was kept on full dose aspirin. given negative cardiac work-up and relation to food intake intake, gi was consulted. dyspepsia kub was unremarkable. gi recommended barium esophagram which showed no strictures but did show ineffective primary peristalsis, minimal reflux, and possible small hiatal hernia. gi recommended that pt have outpatient gi appointment if symptoms continue. if symptoms continue by the time of this appointment, gi will consider egd to rule out esophagitis. bradycardia pt had a few episodes of bradycardia precipitated by po intake which were attributed to increased vagal tone in the context of dyspepsia. ativan adverse reaction we noted that even taking her home dose of ativan resulted in marked sedation. we would suggest avoiding benzodiazepines. leg cramps not an active problem during admission. medications on admission: lisinopril one tab (dose unknown) po daily lorazepam 0.5-1mg po daily prn insomnia, anxiety quinine prn leg cramps discharge medications: 1. docusate sodium 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po bid (2 times a day). 2. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po hs (at bedtime). 3. heparin (porcine) 5,000 unit/ml solution sig: one (1) injection tid (3 times a day): can stop when ambulating frequently. 4. alum-mag hydroxide-simeth 200-200-20 mg/5 ml suspension sig: 15-30 mls po qid (4 times a day) as needed for indigestion. 5. acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets po q6h (every 6 hours) as needed for pain. 6. hydrocortisone 0.5 % cream sig: one (1) appl topical tid (3 times a day) as needed for rash . 7. atorvastatin 80 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 8. pantoprazole 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one (1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po q12h (every 12 hours) as needed for gerd. 9. dipyridamole-aspirin 200-25 mg cap, multiphasic release 12 hr sig: one (1) cap po daily (daily) for 4 days: after four days, increase to [**hospital1 **]. 10. dipyridamole-aspirin 200-25 mg cap, multiphasic release 12 hr sig: one (1) cap po bid (2 times a day): do not start until four days of once daily dosing is completed. 11. lisinopril 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). discharge disposition: extended care facility: [**hospital3 1107**] [**hospital **] [**hospital 1108**] rehab unit at [**hospital6 1109**] - [**location (un) 1110**] discharge diagnosis: primary stroke - ischemic, left posterior cerebral artery atrial septal defect vertebral stenosis secondary hypertension discharge condition: mental status: confused - always. level of consciousness: alert and interactive. activity status: ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane). at baseline she has been more independent, but this is our present recommendation. she has complete right visual field loss and memory impairment. she cannot typically encode new memories at present, particularly when these are episodic or linguistic. discharge instructions: you came to the hospital after having a stroke. this was of the back part of your brain and involves brain areas important for your right visual field (left occipital lobe), along with a brain region important for memory formation (left hippocampus). this has occurred in the context of narrowing of a blood vessel that supplies these regions (vertebral artery). we adjusted your medications to include an antiplatelet [**doctor last name 360**], aggrenox. now that you are medically [**last name (un) 2677**], we feel that you will now benefit from rehabilitation, where you will adapt to the changes that have occurred as a result of this stroke. please attend follow-up listed below. please continue to take your medications as directed. followup instructions: please follow-up in stroke clinic. provider: [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**name11 (nameis) 162**], md phone:[**telephone/fax (1) 2574**] date/time:[**2177-1-17**] 10:30 please follow-up with cardiology: dr.

if stone was not present, then plan was to proceed with administration of iv contrast to further assess for other etiologies of her left flank pain. after initial scan failed to demonstrate kidney stone, iv contrast was administered. within approximately one minute of receiving iv contrast she reports feeling chest heaviness and difficulty breathing. she also reports that her face became swollen, she itched all over and that her throat was itchy. she shouted ""i can't breathe"" while in the ct scanner and was immediately removed from the scanner. she was treated emergently for presumed life-threatening anaphylactoid reaction to iv contrast; in this setting, she received 1 ml of 1:1000 epinephrine (1 mg) intravenously. she was then transferred back to the emergency department and treated with solumedrol, famotidine, benadryl, and bronchodilator nebulizers. she was tachycardic to the 120s and hypotensive to systolic pressure in the 70's, and received intravenous fluid resuscitation with 4 liters of normal saline. she then developed hypoxia and cough with frothy pink sputum, requiring supplemental oxygen by non-rebreather mask. ekg was notable for ischemic st depressions in the inferolateral leads. her cardiac enzymes (normal on presentation) were elevated (troponin of 0.43) when measured after the anaphylaxis episode/epinephrine dose, consistent with acute cardiac injury. she was then transferred to the medical intensive care unit (micu) for further evaluation and treatment. she was admitted to the micu on [**2107-11-21**]. she was treated for acute lung injury/pulmonary edema, volume-responsive shock, and acute myocardial injury ultimately attributed to her anaphylactoid reaction to iv contrast and subsequent administration of 1 mg iv epinephrine at 1:1000 concentration (note the standard dose of epinephrine for anaphylaxis is 0.3 mg sc/im at 1:1000 concentration). echocardiogram on [**2107-11-22**] demonstrated essentially normal cardiac function. ms [**known lastname 22473**] noted the presence of continous substernal chest discomfort;

in this setting she received 1 mg 1:1000 iv epinephrine and developed acute lung injury/pulmonary edema and acute myocardial injury for which she was transferred to the medical intensive care unit as described above. she was subsequently transferred to the medical floor on [**2107-11-22**]. once transferred to the medical floor, her supplemental oxygen was progressively weaned off. despite persistent symptoms of central chest discomfort following her anaphylactoid event, ekg/enzymes failed to demonstrate ongoing/residual cardiac injury. ms [**known lastname 22473**] noted post-prandial nausea/vomiting for several days s/p her icu stay. she was treated with compazine and zofran with minimal relief. with ongoing symptoms, she received a second dose of compazine on [**11-27**]; approximately four hours later, the patient developed facial contortion and left hand spasm felt likely to represent an acute dystonic reaction to the compazine. she was treated with benadryl, cogentin, and valium. after approximately 8-12 hours, her left hand spasm resolved, however ms [**known lastname 22473**] remained unable to open her jaw from a closed position despite repeated dosing of benadryl, cogentin, and valium. she was seen by the neurology consult service and also by dr [**last name (stitle) 2866**] from oral-maxillofacial surgery. although initially unable to speak because of concurrent inability to move her tongue, after two days her tongue ""loosened"" and she was able to communicate verbally despite persistent jaw closure. it was uncertain whether her inability to open the jaw represented trismus vs alternate complication of her dystonic reaction. ms [**known lastname 22473**] was observed during sleep with persistent closed jaw, arguing against conversion disorder. she was maintained on iv fluid hydration and liquid diet by straw. consideration was given to administration of nerve block to facilitate mechanical manipulation to open the jaw, however on [**12-1**] her jaw was released from the closed position after 10 mg iv valium and mechanical manipulation by her mother - once released, ms [**name (ni) 22473**] was able to independently open/close her jaw, eat, and speak without need for further mechanical intervention. in terms of ms [**known lastname 48849**] original complaint of left flank pain, neurology consult service felt that this most likely represented a thoracic radiculopathy related to a herniated disc. her symptoms persisted, in waxing/[**doctor last name 688**] intensity, throughout her hospital course. on [**12-4**], ms [**known lastname 22473**] notice that her right foot was ""turning in"" (ankle inversion) when she walked;

[**2131-1-21**] ct abdomen - marked retroperitoneal and retrocrural lymphadenopathy. two soft tissue density nodules within the mesentery adjacent to the small bowel also likely represent areas of disease involvement. no bowel obstruction. stable appearance of extensive lymphadenopathy within the chest. two millimeter hypodensity within the right posterior segment of the liver, too small to fully characterize. [**2131-1-25**] cxr - bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions are again demonstrated with apparent loculation on the left. these appear unchanged in the interval. overall, since the recent radiograph of earlier the same date, there has not been a significant change in the appearance of the chest. [**2131-1-28**] cxr - left subclavian line tip in the superior vena cava is unchanged. there are bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right. there are bibasilar patchy areas of volume loss. hazy increased opacity in the left mid lung corresponds to known mediastinal mass with adjacent chest wall invasion. compared to the film from 2 days ago, the effusions are slightly smaller. [**2131-1-29**] echo - the left atrium is mildly dilated. left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (lvef>55%). regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. there is a small, echo dense, organized pericardial effusion. compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-1-14**], the small pericardial effusion is more evident on this complete study. [**2131-2-1**] cxr - no interval change in pleural effusions. [**2131-2-5**] cxr - mild pulmonary edema improved since [**1-28**] and 9. contraction of the left hemithorax is longstanding, and left lower lobe atelectasis has been stable since [**1-28**]. small right and moderate left pleural effusion are unchanged. cardiac silhouette is partially obscured by adjacent pleural and parenchymal abnormality but not grossly changed from mild cardiomegaly in the interim. tip of the left subclavian infusion port projects over the svc. no pneumothorax. brief hospital course: 38 yo female with nodular sclerosing hodgkin's lymphoma (diagnosed in [**2123**]) and with disease in her lungs, known left pleural effusion who presented with significant dyspnea on exertion. *hodgkins - the patient has refractery hodgkins disease. she was admitted with known disease relapse and progression. most of her symptoms (pain, dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath, breast swelling) were all thought secondary to disease infiltration. she was given a cycle of ice chemotherapy. she did have neurotoxicity (confusion, hallucinating) that was thought to be from the ifosfomide so it was held on [**2131-1-25**]; and she only received 25% of her final dose. her final dose of the cycle was on [**2131-1-26**]. she reached her nadir at approximately day 7 and then her counts have slowly started to rise. on discharge her wbc was 1.2 with an anc of 840. she will receive a neupogen shot the day after discharge at the office of dr. [**last name (stitle) 50854**] (arranged by [**doctor first name 8513**]). she will follow up with dr. [**last name (stitle) 50854**] and dr. [**first name (stitle) **] this week. she will likely be readmitted for a second cycle of ice next week. *doe: patient has had progressive doe since [**month (only) 216**]. likely [**12-28**] to underlying hodgkin's disease (some reports of paralyzed left diaphragm), pleural effusion and possible overlying pna. recent pfts done as outpatient showed fev1 of 0.8, which suggested obstructive disease. at admission she was tachypneic and febrile and started on empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone for possible pneumonia. imaging done here with cxr and chest ct showed diffuse disease in chest and left sided pleural effusion with almost complete collapse of left lung. ip tried to tap the effusion without success, likely b/c it was loculated. pt had vats on [**1-12**] with expansion of lung and placement of two chest tubes and [**doctor last name **] drain. patient had tachypnea and pain post procedure. had o2 sats in low 90s, upper 80s and did not use much o2 because of history of bleomycin exposure. several days after vats the patient had a desat to 77% on ra and was sent to the intesive care unit. she was clinically stable in the icu and did not require intubation. she had a cta to evaluate for pe and was negative. chest tubes were removed. she was transferred back to the floor after 4 days. she remained stable and was treated with morphine pca and fentanly patch for pain control. the chest was left in place to drain for approxmiately 10 days. the patients symptoms were still persistent after the tube was removed. it was felt that the only way to further improve her symptoms was to treat the underlying disease. she was then given a cycle of ice chemotherapy (see above). during the later half of her hospital stay she was intermittently treated with lasix for sob and put on a steroid taper of dexmethasone (on 2mg [**hospital1 **] upon discharge). repeat x-rays showed improving pulmonary edema after lasix treatment. she was discharged on lasix 40mg po at discharge. (multiple echo's showed a normal ef) *h/o left subclavian vein clot: patient had a left subclavian clot several months prior to admission. she took coumadin as an outpatient. her coumadin was held during the early part of her admission because she was scheduled to have a thoracentesis and then vats and required an inr of <1.5 for these procedures. patient did have some swelling of left breast and left upper extremity. ultrasound of left uppper extremity showed: abnormal finding in the left internal jugular area likely representing a necrotic lymph node and adjacent patent diminutive internal jugular vein. alternatively, if the patient had prior procedures or radiation, this could represent chronic fibrosis with focal chronic thrombus. breast ultrasound showed no fluid collections. the hope is that is the chemotherapy shrinks the disease, there will be improvement in the breast and arm swelling. *fevers: patient had a fever a few weeks prior to admission and was treated with avelox at that time. had fever at admission. blood and urine cultures were checked and were negative. cxr showed large left pleural effusion and she was started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin for now for broad spectrum abx coverage to cover for possible pna hidden behind the effusion. she was treated with a 14 day course ([**date range (2) 50855**]) with no further fevers. the patient remained afebrile off antibiotics. *paralyzed vocal cords: patient was found to have hoarse voice and paralyzed vocal cords in the icu. it was unclear if was secondary to vat or her hodgkin's disease affectling the recurrent laryngeal never. a speech and swallow evaluation was done and then a video swallow that showed the patient was not aspirating. her voice was intermittently improved during her hospital course. *anxiety - the patient had continued anxiety and depression throughout her hospital course. she responded well to starting celexa and xanax. she was continued on this regimen at discharge. of note, she had an adverse reaction to iv ativan (hallucinations, confusion). *hypotension: was hypotensive early in admission (sbps in 90s), with no improvement with ivf. had low bps and nl upo throughout her admission, but remained clinically stable. *tachycardia: pt had sinus tachycardia with unclear source. thought to be secondary to infection or dyspnea secondary to collapsed lung. ivfs did not improve tachycardia. medications on admission: synthroid, 100 mcg qd neurontin 300 mg p.o. qam and afternoon neurontin 600 mg qhs vicodin q4-6 hours prn ativan 1 mg p.r.n coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. qod (has not taken since fri) discharge medications: 1. levothyroxine 100 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). disp:*30 tablet(s)* refills:*3* 2. bisacodyl 5 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: two (2) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po daily (daily). disp:*60 tablet, delayed release (e.c.)(s)* refills:*2* 3. acyclovir 200 mg capsule sig: two (2) capsule po q8h (every 8 hours). disp:*180 capsule(s)* refills:*2* 4. clotrimazole 10 mg troche sig: one (1) troche mucous membrane qid (4 times a day). disp:*120 troche(s)* refills:*2* 5. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160-800 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po qod (). disp:*15 tablet(s)* refills:*2* 6. prochlorperazine 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po q6h (every 6 hours) as needed for nausea. disp:*30 tablet(s)* refills:*0* 7. zolpidem 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po hs (at bedtime) as needed for sleep. disp:*30 tablet(s)* refills:*3* 8. citalopram 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). disp:*30 tablet(s)* refills:*2* 9. alprazolam 0.25 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po tid (3 times a day) as needed for anxiety. disp:*90 tablet(s)* refills:*0* 10. vicodin es 7.5-750 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po every four (4) hours as needed for pain. disp:*90 tablet(s)* refills:*0* 11. morphine 15 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets po every 4-6 hours as needed for pain. disp:*60 tablet(s)* refills:*0* 12. protonix 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one (1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po once a day. disp:*30 tablet, delayed release (e.c.)(s)* refills:*2* 13. dexamethasone 2 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po twice a day. disp:*60 tablet(s)* refills:*2* 14. lasix 40 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once a day. disp:*30 tablet(s)* refills:*2* discharge disposition: home with service facility: [**hospital1 3894**] health vna discharge diagnosis: hodgkins lymphoma discharge condition: stable; o2 sats in the mid 90's discharge instructions: --please take all medications as prescribed. use your oxygen as needed when you have difficulty breathing. --you will need be closely followed in the outpatient clinic. please make sure to go to all of your appointments. followup instructions: --you have an appointment with dr.

[**known lastname 51035**] is a 75 year old female with a history of seizure disorder who presented from her rehab facility with questionable seizures and fevers. per report, the patient was found yesterday evening by workers at the facility to be aphasic, not responding to commands or questions. at that time the workers thought she was just tired and left her alone. in the morning at change of shift, care takers who were more familiar with the patient's clinical status were concerned she was having a seizure. additionally, at that time temperatures were reocrded at 101.4 at rehab. . in the

hypersensitivity reaction, as to a drug. clinical: specimen submitted: left abdomen. clinical: 76 yr. old male with sepsis and on many antibiotics for past 6 weeks with morbilliform rash. please evaluate for drug hypersensitivity, agep, dress, vasculitis, infectious, toxic erythema. gross: the specimen is received in a formalin filled container labeled with the patient's name ""[**known firstname **] [**initials (namepattern4) **] [**known lastname 52513**]"", medical record number and date of birth. specimen consists of a punch of skin measuring 4.4 cm in diameter excised to a depth of 0.8 cm. the surface of the skin is remarkable for an irregularly-shaped light pink papule measuring 0.3 x 0.3 cm. the margin is inked in blue. the specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette a. brief hospital course: this is a 76 year old gentleman w/ a hitory of cardiomyopathy, af not on coumadin, recurrent nonhealing ulcers and recent osteomyelitis transferred from [**hospital3 **] with severe sepsis w/o definite source. active issues #. shock: the pt was transferred to [**hospital1 18**] micu in shock, likely due to combination -of septic and cardiogenic etiologies. he was treated empirically for sepsis with broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and meropenem for 7 days. weaned off all pressors on [**8-4**]. no source of infection was identified and antibiotics were discontinued on [**8-7**]. he was afebrile and hd stable at the time of transfer to medicine floor. the etiology of his sepsis was not identified. at the time of discharge, pt had been stable off of antibiotics and was afebrile without leukocytosis. # ischemic cardiomyopathy: ef 20-30% on echo ([**8-1**]). a nstemi prior to transfer to [**hospital1 18**] cannot be ruled out given slightly elevated ckmb and troponin. lisinopril, and spironolactone were held. asa and plavix were continued. his statin was restarted. he was given iv lasix for volume overload and responded well to doses of 120 iv. he was put on metoprolol 12.5 mg [**hospital1 **]. his lisinopril and spironolactone were still on hold at the time of discharge because of unstable kidney function. on telemetry, there has been frequent asymptomatic pvc and nsvt. # [**last name (un) **]/ckd: patient developed acute renal failure and required cvvh while in the micu in the setting of hypotension and shock likely related to atn. renal was consulted, his urine sedimentation showed granular casts without muddy brown casts. he was not hyperkalemic, acidotic or uremic. at the time of transfer to medicine floor he did not need further cvvh though he was oligouric making 300cc or urine on the day prior to transfer. in the setting of low free water intake he became hypernatremic with a free water deficit. the hypernatremia and uop improved with diuresis and d5w resuscitation. his creatinine was stable around 2 at time of discharge. # respiratory failure: he was intubated for inadequate compensation for metabolic acidosis/concomitant respiratory acidosis. he was extubated on [**8-5**]. upon transfer to [**hospital1 **] he was breathing well on 3l o2. on the medical floor, he occasionally required 2l nc to maintain his o2 saturation above 90%. he had one night of desaturation into the 70s when sleeping which required transfer to the micu. this was most likely secondary to chronic air trapping with obesity hypoventilation and pulmonary edema as his lasix had been held in the setting of increased diarrhea from cdiff. his oxygenation improved with diuresis and cpap, and he was transferred back to the floor. sleep medicine evaluated the patient who recommended bipap 10/5 when sleeping. # upper extremity non-occlusive thrombi: reported history of cns bleed, according to the pcp, [**name10 (nameis) **] had a spontaneous intracranial hemorrheage. anticoagulation was held given history of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. upper extremity us showed multiple ij thrombi and a thrombus at the picc site. picc was d/ced, left arm swelling decreased. vascular was consulted about possible svc filter but recommended against placement at this time. he is scheduled for outpatient vascular follow up. # c. diff: patient was noted to have diarrhea on [**8-15**]. cdiff was positive. he was started on po vancomycin. he remained afebrile without leukocytosis and his diarrhea improved. he was discharged with plans to complete a 14 day course of po vancomycin (last day [**2172-8-29**]). # pusutular drug reaction: the pt developed a body rash at osh, although exact cause of the reaction was unclear. review of discharge medications from life care [**location (un) 3320**] was unrevealing as there were no new medications at the time of discharge. however, it is unclear which meds were given while he was at rehabilitation. he completed a course of clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment with marked improvement. per dermatology, this is consistent with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (agep), a drug reaction, although unclear which medication at the rehab was the culprit. if recurs, will need to follow lft and eos. rash had resolved by discharge. new erythematous blanching rash on abdomen and thighs started on [**8-18**], is stable and likely from irritation. this will need to be monitored at rehab. #. atrial fibrilation with rvr: cardiology was consulted and recommended rate control with metoprolol and continued diuresis. he was maintained on telemetry. he was not anticoagulated for afib as he had hx of spontaneous intracranial bleeding. # osteomyelitis: pt has a history of unhealing ulcers secondary to pvd. amputation was suggested, but declined by the patient in the past. he developed osteomyelitis about 2 months prior to admission, and treated with 6 wk course of vanco/zosyn for right non-healing ulcer. imaging [**7-29**] at osh showed slight worsening vs prior. at [**hospital1 18**], on [**7-31**], plain film of the right foot was concerning for osteomyeltiis involving right #5 metatarsal. esr and crp on [**2172-8-8**] unremarkable. podiatry did a biopsy through the wound, cultures were negative (on antibiotics). podiatry ecommended local wound care, wet to dry dressings, off-loading multipodus boots. weight bearing status: pwbat to right heel. he will need to follow up with podiatry after discharge. # ischemic toes: the pt was noted to have necrotic toes concerning of ischemia in setting of coming off pressors. his non invasive aterial study on [**8-7**] showed monophasic dp on r and triphasic pedal pulses on l. vascular surgery was consulted and felt that observation with follow up as an outpatient was appropriate. # agitation/ams: this occured while pt was on the floor and differential included hypoglycemia vs hypernatremia vs ongoing occult infection. his nighttime insulin dose was decreased. hypernatremia was treated with d5w. respiratory distress also a factor which improved during the day with stimulation and family members. # swollen painful scrotum: concerning for fournier's gangerene, urology consulted and found no evidence of fournier's on u/s or ct. he responded to repositioning. this was likely due to edema from fluid overload. # dm: on glargine and insulin sliding scale. # communication: wife [**name (ni) **] [**telephone/fax (2) 52514**]c

condition: mental status: confused - sometimes. level of consciousness: alert and interactive. activity status: bedbound. discharge instructions: dear mr. [**known lastname 52513**], it was a pleasure taking care of you at the [**hospital1 771**]. you were transferred from an outside hosiptal with sepsis, which is a serious illness that happens when an infection affects the whole body so your heart had trouble to supply your organs. after aggressive medical management including strong antibiotics, blood pressure medications, respiratory support, cardiovascular support, you were able to recover from the serious illness. the source of your infection was not identified despite our best effort in multiple radiology scans, and labs tests. however, due to your serious condition, a number of your organs have been affected. your kidney was damaged for lack of blood supply. fortunately, it has improved and you did not require dialysis. your toes turned blue because of lack of blood supply. secondly, you came in with a diffuse body rash that we thought was caused by a drug reaction. the drug that might have caused your rash was never identified. your rash improved with a steroid cream. also, in the search of your infection source we found multiple clots in your upper arms where the iv lines previously were placed. you did not have occlusion of your arm vessels. we did not give you blood thinning medications given your adverse reaction to coumadin in the past. you also had an infection of your bowel with a bacteria called clostridium difficile which causes diarrhea. it was treated with oral vancomycin which you will continue until [**2172-8-29**]. you also had trouble breathing which required a transfer to the medical icu for one night. you were placed on cpap breathing machine and given more lasix which improved your symptoms and you were able to come back to the medical floor. you also received intravenous medication to remove fluids from your body. we were able to make some progress. however it appears that this process will take some time. we think that you may benefit from further diuresis in a rehab setting, where more targeted nursing and physical therapy could also be provided. please note that a number of changes have been made to your medications. please follow up with your providers as scheduled. you will need to be seen by cardiology and vascular surgery providers. you should also follow up in the sleep clinic to help manage your sleep apnea. followup instructions: department: vascular surgery when: tuesday [**2172-9-1**] at 10:30 am with: [**first name11 (name pattern1) **] [**last name (namepattern4) 1244**], md [**telephone/fax (1) 1237**] building: lm [**hospital unit name **] [**location (un) **] campus: west best parking: [**hospital ward name **] garage we are working on a follow up appointment for your hospitalization in pulmonary sleep medicine. it is recommended you be seen within 1 month of discharge. the office will contact you with the appointment information. if you have not heard within a few business days please call the office at [**telephone/fax (1) 612**]. department: cardiac services when: tuesday [**2172-9-1**] at 2:00 pm with: [**name6 (md) **] [**last name (namepattern4) 6738**], md [**telephone/fax (1) 62**] building: sc [**hospital ward name 23**] clinical ctr [**location (un) **] campus: east best parking: [**hospital ward name 23**] garage completed by:[**2172-8-23**]",1
61,"admission date: [**2113-11-1**] discharge date: [**2113-11-17**] date of birth: [**2069-3-16**] sex: m service: medicine history of present illness: the patient is a 44-year-old gentleman with a history of alcohol abuse and alcohol-induced cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation, and upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs who was admitted to an outside hospital on [**2113-10-25**] with atrial fibrillation and a rapid ventricular response. it was thought at this time that he was in acute alcohol withdrawal. he was treated with diltiazem given by intravenous bolus and by drip for rate control and ativan with withdrawals. he subsequently developed facial edema and airway edema requiring emergent intubation for airway protection. it is unclear at this time what the initial precipitant was for possible angioedema. he also received protonix at one point during hs hospitalization there. the patient was transferred from [**hospital6 2561**] to the [**hospital1 69**] intensive care unit on [**11-2**] for further management. at [**hospital1 69**], the [**hospital 228**] hospital course was significant for group g streptococcus sepsis; possibly from a cellulitic skin source which has been treated with ceftriaxone. he developed hypotension and required a short course of neo-synephrine. his atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response was eventually treated with digoxin with good rate control. he spontaneously converted into a normal sinus rhythm during his hospital course. his intensive care unit course was also notable for delta multiple sclerosis thought to be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy with a minimal response to rectal lactulose. he also developed a left lung collapse secondary to mucous plugging. the patient received bronchoscopy two times with aggressive suctioning on [**11-9**] and [**11-10**] with eventual re-expansion of his left lower lobe. he failed a speech and swallow evaluation after he was extubated on [**2113-11-11**]. he was also noted to have some trouble with his cough and had a hoarse voice after extubation, thought to be residual from his angioedema. past medical history: 1. alcohol abuse with a history of alcohol withdrawal seizures and hallucinosis. 2. atrial fibrillation. 3. upper gastrointestinal bleed thought secondary to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use. 4. chronic back pain. 5. anxiety. 6. alcohol-induced cirrhosis. 7. interatrial septal aneurysms. 8. chronic deep venous thrombosis with collaterals. 9. hepatitis b and hepatitis c negative at outside hospital. medications on transfer: (from intensive care unit) 1. digoxin 0.1 mg by mouth once per day 2. pepcid 20 mg by mouth twice per day. 3. lactulose 300 mg per rectum twice per day. 4. albuterol as needed. 5. miconazole powder. 6. ceftriaxone (day 10 as of [**2113-11-12**]). 7. tylenol. 8. vitamin k times three. allergies: aspirin, diltiazem, and ativan are questioned for anaphylaxis. social history: the patient is homeless. he lives in a shelter. his cousin is his health care proximally, and he has a sister who lives in [**name (ni) 108**] with whom he is not in communication. family history: family history was unknown. physical examination on presentation: on physical examination, vital signs were stable with a temperature of 98.4 degrees fahrenheit, his blood pressure was 92/38, his respiratory rate was 22, and his oxygen saturation was 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula. in general, the patient was a middle-aged gentleman who was alert. he had some garbled speech and was nonsensical at times. he had a hoarse voice. the lungs had rhonchi bilaterally but greater on the right than on the left. he had 1+ pedal edema and proximal muscle wasting. he had some dilated veins of his upper thorax. pertinent laboratory values on presentation: significant laboratory data revealed the patient's platelet count was 42 (which was stable during his hospitalization). his mean cell volume was 101. his chemistry-7 was normal. his inr was 1.7, prothrombin time was 15.9, and partial thromboplastin time was 29.9. pertinent radiology/imaging: an echocardiogram from [**11-2**] showed an ejection fraction of 60% to 70%. no interatrial septal defects. normal left ventricular and right ventricular function. mitral regurgitation of 2+ and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation. trace pericardial effusions. no vegetations were seen on transesophageal echocardiogram. on [**11-3**], a right upper quadrant ultrasound showed an echogenic liver consistent with cirrhosis and a hyperechoic lesion in the posterior right lobe. there was small free fluid around the liver and some cholelithiasis. no ductal dilatation or gallbladder wall thickening was seen on ultrasound. a chest x-ray from [**11-12**] showed a patchy retrocardiac density and a slight increase in atelectasis. on [**11-11**], an upper extremity ultrasound showed a chronic occlusion of right internal jugular with collateralization. acute thrombus about the brachial vein with normal flow through the second brachial vein. concise summary of hospital course by issue/system: in brief, the patient is a 44-year-old gentleman with a history of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, and a prolonged admission to the medical intensive care unit for alcohol withdrawal, complicated by anaphylaxis to possibly diltiazem versus ativan or protonix, and group b streptococcus sepsis. he also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and mucous plugging. the patient was transferred to the regular medical floor on [**2113-11-12**]. 1. hypoxia issues: the patient's cough continued to improve during his hospital stay. he had no further episodes of desaturations, and he was able to clear his secretions. a chest x-ray on [**11-16**] showed interval improvement of the left lower lobe collapse and consolidation with clear lung fields. 2. delta multiple sclerosis issues: the patient was noted to have some delirium status post his intensive care unit stay. this continued to clear each day and was thought to be multifactorial with an element of hypoxia, hepatic encephalopathy, and alcohol-induced encephalopathy causing his change in mental status. he had a head computed tomography that was negative for any acute bleed or mass; although there was note of a calcification in the left frontoparafalcine region measuring 6 mm in its greatest dimension which was thought to be related to angioma, although of unclear etiology. he also was noted to have mild brain atrophy on a head computed tomography. by the time of discharge, the patient was able to engage in conversation appropriately and follow commands. 3. angioedema issues: since the angioedema was not witnessed during this hospitalization, it was unclear at this time whether he actually had an episode of angioedema. the allergy service was consulted and they suggested that the patient have a re-challenge of ativan an diltiazem as an outpatient. thyroid studies were sent here which showed a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone and a free t4. his c4 level was within normal limits, and his c1 level was an out of hospital study which was still pending. it appeared highly unlikely that the patient developed angioedema secondary to ativan since he has received ativan multiple times in the past without any adverse reactions. 4. group b streptococcus sepsis issues: the patient was to complete a 21-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone as per infectious disease consultation. as of today's dictation, the patient was on day 16/21. all surveillance cultures have been negative thus far. after the patient has completed his course of antibiotics, he should have surveillance cultures drawn as an outpatient. 5. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation issues: the patient is now in a sinus rhythm; although, it appears that he is at high risk for having recurrent atrial fibrillation given that his left atrium was enlarged on an echocardiogram done at this institution. however, given his alcohol abuse and current unsteady gait, the patient was at a high risk for falls. will continue digoxin for rate control for now, and would reconsider whether the patient would be able to be compliant with outpatient anticoagulation. he was not started on any oral anticoagulation during this hospitalization. 6. cirrhosis issues: the patient has thrombocytopenia which was most likely due to cirrhosis and splenic sequestration. he also had an elevated inr which was most likely due to liver failure. the patient has a history of portal vein thrombosis which is currently stable. from an ultrasound done on [**11-15**], there was no reversal of flow noted. it was unclear at this time whether the patient has had an evaluation for varies; however, this should be done as an outpatient. in terms of his hepatic encephalopathy, he was continued on lactulose 30 mg by mouth three times per day with good effect. he should have an outpatient hepatology appointment once his rehabilitation stay has finished. 7. speech and swallow issues: the patient passed a speech and swallow test several days after his medical intensive care unit stay. he was able to tolerate a full diet without any difficulties and no longer had to remain nothing by mouth. he was not longer at risk for aspiration. discharge diagnoses: 1. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 2. alcohol withdrawal. 3. cirrhosis. 4. angioedema of unclear etiology. 5. aspiration pneumonia and mucous plugging causing respiratory failure. 6. group b streptococcus sepsis. 7. hepatic encephalopathy. 8. anemia and thrombocytopenia secondary to cirrhosis and alcohol bone marrow suppression. condition at discharge: condition on discharge was stable. discharge status: to a rehabilitation facility. medications on discharge: 1. ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously q.24h. 2. albuterol inhaler as needed. 3. famotidine 20 mg by mouth once per day. 4. digoxin 0.125 mg by mouth once per day. 5. multivitamin one tablet by mouth once per day. 6. lactulose 30 mg by mouth three times per day. discharge instructions/followup: 1. the patient was to have a peripherally inserted central catheter line placed on [**2113-11-17**] to complete his antibiotic course. 2. the patient was to observe a regular diet with aspiration precautions.

edema. eeg [**2122-9-4**]: impression: this is an abnormal routine eeg due to the slow background, generalized bursts of slow activity, and multifocal slow transients with triphasic features. these findings suggest a widespread encephalopathy afecting both cortical and subcortical structures. medications, metabolic disturbancies and infections are among the most common causes. there were no lateralized or epileptiform features noted. abdominal ct with contrast [**2122-9-4**]: impression: no evidence of abdominal inflammatory process, or other specific ct finding to explain abdominal

definite interval change in the appearance of the brain compared to the prior study. brief hospital course: 1) altered mental status: pt with similar presentations in the past. labs to evaluate for a toxic-metabolic cause were unrevealing. she was initially treated with cipro for a suspected uti, but stopped on day 2 as this drug can lower the seizure threshold and urine grew mixed flora. head imaging with ct and mri was unrevealing. eeg showed generalized slowing. on the morning of [**9-5**] during her hd treatment, she became very agitated, confused, and then unresponsive. her arms were clutched to her chest in fists and her eyes were deviated to the left. she was given 1 mg of ativan and remained disoriented and somnolent, presumably postictal. of note, she was also dialyzed earlier on the day of admission. neurology was consulted and felt her presentation was due to fluid and electrolyte shifts with hd and recommended [**date range 13401**] for her apparent seizure. dilantin was avoided due to prior drug related angioedema. she remained confused and agitated, and her somnolence increased. she was vomiting and minimally responsive to sternal rub. she was transferred to the micu for observation, received iv haldol for agitation, and was called out the next day as she remained stable. she subsequently received hd two more times with no adverse reaction. her mental status improved and she was a&ox3 at discharge, although likely with some chronic cognitive deficits. her sertraline was held during this admission as well as on discharge, and can be addressed as an outpatient. 2) esrd on hd: she was continued on her tu/th/sat hd schedule. she was continued on nephrocaps and cinacalcet and started on sevelamer. 3) history of dvt/svc syndrome: her inr was initially subtherapeutic at 1.6 and she was bridged on a heparin drip. with warfarin 5mg daily, it improved to 1.9. however, her heparin and warfarin were held when her mental status deteriorated. once ct head showed no bleed, her heparin was continued. when decision was made to not perform lp, her warfarin was restarted and heparin was stopped due to a therapeutic inr of 2.2. medications on

in the emergency department, the patient's ekg revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 127 with 2.5mm st depressions in leads v3-v5, ii, avf. given the patient's history, she was placed on droplet precautions and a nasopharyngeal aspirate was performed to evaluate for influenza. her ekg changes were attributed to demand ischemia in the setting of a rapid rate. she was continued on metoprolol and diltiazem. on hospital day #2, the patient's heart rate increased to the 160s and she became increasingly short of breath and developed significant respiratory distress. an arterial blood gas was performed and revealed: 7.15/88/125. the patient was placed on mask ventilation and transferred to the intensive care unit where she was intubated. micu course: *respiratory failure: the patient's respiratory failure was likely secondary to influenza, copd exacerbation and flash pulmonary edema due to af with rapid ventricular rate. the patient had a direct influenza a antigen test which was positive for influenza a viral antigen. the viral culture revealed hemadsorption positive virus. she was treated with amantadine for a total of 5 days. the patient was treated aggressively for copd flare with solu-medrol and frequent nebulizer treatments. she was transitioned to 60mg po prednisone on [**2196-1-8**]. this should be tapered slowly over the course of [**2-4**] weeks as tolerated. the patient developed a new cxr opacity while in the micu and was treated for a superimposed bacterial pneumonia with vancomycin and levofloxacin. the patient developed a rash on her trunk and extremities. the etiology of rash was not clear but the possibility that this was an adverse reaction to vancomycin or levaquin has been entertained. skin eruption responded to benadryl iv and resolved by the time of transfer out of the micu after abx were discontinued. she completed a course of levofloxacin. the patient was extubated on [**2196-1-7**] and o2 was weaned. *af with rvr: the patient was initially started on a diltiazem drip but continued to require boluses of iv metoprolol with sub-optimal rate control. she was loaded with digoxin on [**1-6**] and continued on digoxin. her rate did decrease somewhat with this regimen. her coumadin was continued initially but then held for elevated inr likely from coumadin interaction with levofloxacin. *hypotension: the patient was transiently hypotensive in the micu and required pressor support and multiple ivf boluses. with treatment of her infection and weaning of sedation, the patient's blood pressure normalized. *colonic pseudo-obstruction: the patient had severe constipation while in the icu likely secondary to fentanyl effect on intestinal motility. she was given neostigmine with good result and then was continued on an aggressive bowel regimen and reglan. *hyperglycemia: the patient was started on an insulin gtt for tight glucose control. she was transitioned to a regular insulin sliding scale prior to transfer from the micu. *fen: the patient was started on tube feeds while intubated. after extubation, she underwent a swallowing study which revealed no signs of aspiration but swallowing was a respiratory demand for her and she could easily desat if feed to quickly. recommendations included: 1. diet of thin liquids and pureed solids. straws are okay. 2. please feed slowly with rest between bites/sips trying to keep sats in low 90's. pt was transferred to medical floor on [**2196-1-9**]. the remainder of her hospital course was significant for the following issues. af with rvr: the patient was transitioned to po diltiazem, metoprolol and digoxin. the patient's rate was consistently in the 105-120 range with occasional bursts to 150-160. she was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable. she will need to follow up with cardiology as an outpatient and it might be worth consider whether she is a candidate for av node ablation with pm placement. the patient's inr was elevated upon transfer from the micu. this elevation was thought to be due to interaction of coumadin and levofloxacin. the patient's coumadin was held and should continue to be held until her inr reaches goal of [**2-4**]. chf: the patient has a known ef of 50%. she had some evidence of diastolic dysfunction. she was total body overloaded (> 10 liter positive) upon transfer from the micu but diuresed well with lasix. she will need continued diuresis of 750-1l of fluid per day until euvolemic. copd: she was transitioned to 60mg po prednisone on [**2196-1-8**]. this should be tapered slowly over the course of [**2-4**] weeks as tolerated. colonic pseudo-obstruction: the patient was continued on reglan and an aggressive bowel regimen. she had several bowel movements and her abdominal distention was improving. hyperglycemia: continued on riss fen: prior to discharge, speech and swallow were re-consulted for evaluation oral candidiasis: the patient received nystatin for mild oral thrush.

accommodation. the extraocular movements are intact. sclera are anicteric. the patient had dry mucous membranes. she had no jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy and no carotid bruits. the heart was regular rate and rhythm, distant heart sounds, right upper sternal border systolic murmur. the lungs were bilaterally clear to auscultation anteriorly with crackles laterally. the abdomen was soft, obese, positive bowel sounds and tender in the lower quadrants secondary to proximity to the groin region. she had multiple ecchymoses over her abdomen. extremities showed no cyanosis or clubbing but had brawny pitting edema up to the midleg with good dorsalis pedis pulses but tibial pulses were blunted by pitting edema. hospital course: the patient was admitted to the ccu for overnight observation of her bilateral groin hematomas which remained stable until morning. her hematocrit also remained stable. given the above, the patient was transferred to the floor and restarted on heparin drip and coumadin for therapy for her atrial flutter and status post electrophysiologic ablation. the patient's other cardiology tests showed: cardiac catheterization showed moderate aortic stenosis, markedly elevated filling pressures with preserved cardiac output and index and mild one vessel coronary artery disease. resting hemodynamics demonstrated severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures with a wedge of 32. her cardiac output and index were preserved with moderate systemic arterial hypertension and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension. there was moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 51 and a mean gradient of 37 with a calculated valve area of 0.9 centimeter squared. selective coronary angiography of the right dominant circulation demonstrated mild one vessel disease. the left main coronary artery, left circumflex and right coronary artery were angiographically normal. the left anterior descending had a mild proximal stenosis of 30%. the patient remained in atrial flutter throughout the case. the patient had moderate arterial hematoma after her arterial sheath was pulled and hemostasis was achieved by manual compression with the use of a clamp. the patient had also had an echocardiogram performed the same day which showed right atrium was normal in size, no atrial septal defect was visible, left systolic function appeared depressed, right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were normal, focal calcifications in the aortic root with simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. there were three aortic valve leaflets. the aortic valve leaflets were severely thickened and deformed and there was 1+ aortic regurgitation. the mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened with mild thickening of the mitral valve chordae. there was 1+ mitral regurgitation. tricuspid valve leaflets were normal as were the pulmonic valve leaflets. there was a small pericardial effusion. no spontaneous echocardiographic contrast or thrombus was seen in the body of the left atrium, atrial appendage, body of right atrium/right atrial appendage. no atrial septal defect was seen. given the above, the patient was expected to be discharged on coumadin, however, her groin hematomas continued to expand and she was subsequently sent for a ct scan of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out retroperitoneal hemorrhage. these showed a large right groin hematoma extending into the anterior abdominal wall without retroperitoneal extension. there was no way to assess for arterial extravasation given the lack of intravenous contrast. the patient also had small bilateral pleural effusions and cholelithiasis. the patient also had an ultrasound performed of the right femoral artery which showed that there was a large heterogeneous mass in the right groin compatible with hematoma. there was no pseudoaneurysm identified throughout the examination and the examination was somewhat limited by the presence of a large hematoma. there was normal venous flow on the veins distally suggesting that there was no av fistula present. given the above, the patient was thought to be stable and was put in for a repeat hematocrit. this repeat hematocrit showed a significant drop and the patient was reexamined and found to have a drop in blood pressure and also a drop in urine output. therefore, she was transferred from the floor back to the ccu, was aggressively rehydrated with fluids p.o. and intravenously, packed red blood cells. the patient received four units of packed red blood cells before being sent with vascular surgery to the operating room for surgical exploration of her right groin hematoma. the patient returned and was found to have increased drainage through her [**location (un) 1661**]-[**location (un) 1662**] drains, status post procedure. therefore, vascular surgery was called to reevaluate the right groin hematoma. an addendum is to be added to this dictation.

66,"admission date: [**2161-3-6**] discharge date: [**2161-3-19**] date of birth: [**2094-3-14**] sex: m service: medicine chief complaint: pulmonary embolism found incidentally on a routine staging ct. history of present illness: the patient is a 66 year old male who was most recently discharged from the hospital on [**2161-3-4**]. he had been in his usual state of good health until approximately mid-[**month (only) 958**] when he began to notice dark colored urine, [**doctor last name 352**] colored stools and jaundice. subsequent workup including abdominal cat, liver biopsy as well as multiple ercps as well as multiple interventional radiology interventions, concluded the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma at the head of the pancreas with liver metastasis as well as biliary obstruction. during the past hospital admission patient underwent interventional radiology stenting for a biliary drain and had a routine staging chest ct prior to discharge. review of the ct revealed a pulmonary embolism in a proximal branch of the right pulmonary artery extending to the right lower lobe. the radiologist communicated this to the discharge attending and patient was called back to [**hospital1 18**]. in the emergency department patient had a ct of the head done which showed no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass shift, shift of midline structures or enhancing masses seen. there was no obvious intracranial hemorrhage or obvious metastasis. patient was then started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation for the pulmonary embolism and admitted to the medicine service. review of systems: the patient reports he has had dyspnea for approximately two weeks which has not changed since his past admission. he particularly noticed that he is fatigued while climbing stairs. he denies chest pain, cough, fever, hemoptysis. he denies nausea, vomiting. he denies diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum or melena. stools are normal color now. past medical history: benign gastric cancer, status post partial gastrectomy in [**2142**]. status post right inguinal hernia repair and left inguinal hernia repair. denies coronary artery disease, hypertension or diabetes. right achilles tendon heel rupture, status post repair. right knee surgery for a question of cartilage problems, status post surgery. recently diagnosed pancreatic cancer with liver metastasis, status post biliary stent placement and intervention. allergies: no known drug allergies. adverse reactions: codeine causes nausea. social history: the patient smoked one pack per day of cigarettes times 40 years. he quit approximately two weeks prior to admission when diagnosed with cancer. he is a social drinker and drinks a few drinks every week. he is married and lives on [**hospital3 **] with his wife. [**name (ni) **] previously worked in auto repair, but is now retired. family history: brother died of pancreatic cancer 1.5 years ago. physical examination: vital signs on admission were temperature 99, heart rate 107, blood pressure 149/74, respiratory rate 28, o2 saturation 97% in room air. heent normocephalic, atraumatic. scleral icterus. extraocular motions intact. pupils equally round and reactive to light. neck was supple, there was no lymphadenopathy. pulmonary diminished breath sounds bilaterally and poor air movement, but with good inspiratory effort. had bibasilar crackles. cardiac s1, s2, normal, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops or rubs, no elevated jvd. abdomen normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, had a biliary drain intact, nontender. there was no erythema, rebound, guarding. there was trace guaiac positive biliary fluid. there was tenderness in the right upper quadrant and left upper quadrant. on gu exam trace guaiac positive, but patient had positive hemorrhoids. extremities no lower extremity edema. dorsalis pedis 2+ pulses bilaterally. neuro aao times four. cranial nerves ii-xii intact. no focal weakness. good muscle tone and strength. laboratory data: sodium 138, potassium 4.1, chloride 102, bicarb 23, bun 23, creatinine 0.8, glucose 150. white blood count 18.9, hematocrit 30.1, platelets 431. inr 1.2, ptt 23.9. cea 547, ca19-9 226,937. ct of the chest inferior posterior margin of pericardium with a 7 to 8 mm nodular density. small hiatal hernia. atelectasis. a 4 mm subpleural nodular density along the lateral aspect of the left lower lobe. there was no effusion. there was a filling defect of the proximal branch of the right pulmonary artery extending to the right middle lobe and right lower lobe. the appearance of this was consistent with pulmonary emboli. the impression of the ct was that intraluminal filling defects within the pulmonary artery branches to both the right middle lobe and right lower lobe were consistent with pulmonary emboli. ct of the abdomen multiple low attenuation lesions of the liver, low attenuation of the head of the pancreas. ct of the head no intracranial or extracranial hemorrhage, no metastasis. ekg sinus rhythm, rate 90 beats per minute, normal axis, no st-t wave changes. assessment: this is a 66 year old white male with a history of recently diagnosed pancreatic cancer who was called back to [**hospital1 18**] for pulmonary embolism which was found incidentally on a routine staging ct. as there is no contraindication for anticoagulation (negative head ct, guaiac negative stools), patient was started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation. patient subsequently had a prolonged hospital course and the hospital course will be dictated by date. hospital course: on [**2161-3-6**] patient had a head ct, no metastasis to the head, no intracranial or extracranial hemorrhage. patient was started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation and was then subsequently changed to lovenox. patient as well as his wife received teaching on lovenox administration. oncology consult (dr. [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**last name (namepattern1) **]/dr. [**last name (stitle) **]. driver) came and evaluated patient again and felt that the best anticoagulation therapy would be lovenox. they felt that once his bilirubin normalized, treatment options would include weekly intravenous therapy with gemcitabine or oral therapy with capecitabine. due to his high bilirubin and the potential interactions of coumadin with capecitabine, the oncology consult recommended dosing of enoxaparin (lovenox) instead of coumadin as anticoagulation. patient wished to receive treatment on [**location (un) **] and doctors [**name5 (ptitle) **]/driver referred him to a local oncologist in [**hospital1 1562**]. additionally, interventional radiology saw the patient and took him to the ir suite for evaluation of his stent. this evaluation revealed a patent common bile duct, however, a new diagnosis of stenosis proximal to the common bile duct stent was seen. ir felt that patient needed additional biliary stenting at a later point in time. on [**2161-3-7**] biliary drainage turned bloody with some clots in the drainage bag. there was a question of whether this was secondary to tumor bleeding, possible liver bleeding with anticoagulation or possible tube track-communication to the portal branch of one of the vessels. approximately 20 cc of bloody clot was found in the bag, but patient was hemodynamically stable. interventional radiology was notified and evaluated patient. on [**2161-3-8**] the patient began to have abdominal pain, particularly lower back pain. there were small amounts of bloody drainage in his biliary bag. patient began to complain of nausea and positive vomiting. abdomen was soft, nontender with no rebound initially. it appeared that there was no output from the stent and that the biliary drainage catheter was obstructed. secondary to the concern for retroperitoneal bleed/tumor bleeding/any further bleeding, ct of the abdomen was done stat to evaluate patient's abdomen. the results of the ct abdomen showed again liver with numerous hypodense lesions consistent with metastasis, but there were no signs of intrahepatic ductal dilatation, no evidence of hemorrhage of the liver lesions and no evidence of bleeding into the abdomen/retroperitoneal area. in addition, patient's white blood count increased from 19 to 28 and there was question of whether this was a stress response versus infection. since patient was afebrile, hemodynamically stable and there began to be minimal output from his biliary drain, it was decided that patient would be closely watched overnight and if there were any problems, patient would be started on empiric antibiotic therapy. in addition, lovenox was discontinued on [**2161-3-8**] in the a.m. after patient had episodes of bloody clots in his bag. over the night the patient had one to two teaspoons of coffee ground emesis and his biliary bag became completely occluded. there was no drainage in the bag whatsoever. in the early morning of [**2161-3-9**] (2:00 to 4:00 a.m.) the patient became febrile to 101.7, blood pressure 90/40, heart rate in the 140s, respiratory rate 26, o2 saturation 96% in room air. there was extreme concern for infection given that his biliary stent appeared to be occluded. blood cultures times two were drawn, patient began to be aggressively hydrated with fluids and patient was started on empiric ampicillin/levofloxacin/flagyl for triple antibiotic coverage. patient's respiratory rate began to increase greatly to the upper 30s and an abg was drawn. this revealed ph of 7.48, pco2 26, po2 39. lactic acid level was 5.7. ekg was done which showed sinus tachycardia, no st-t wave changes. at this point in time it was felt that patient likely had ascending cholangitis secondary to undrained biliary fluid which was leading to sepsis and acidemia. interventional radiology was immediately notified and plans were made to take patient to the interventional suite. patient was hydrated very aggressively with 3 to 4 liters of normal saline and still had decreased urine output. his jvd was flat. in the interventional radiology suite patient's biliary catheter was upsized. at this point in time there was no evidence of a blood clot. ir found his abdomen to be soft, nondistended, nontender. they found that his biliary catheter was patent and the bile was brown after upsizing the drain. secondary to the patient's hypertension/tachycardia/sepsis/ascending cholangitis, patient was taken straight from the interventional radiology suite to the medical intensive care unit. in the micu a left subclavian central axis line as well as an arterial line were placed. he was hydrated aggressively with iv fluids (normal saline) as he appeared to be intravascularly depleted with low blood pressure, tachycardia and decreased urine output. patient did not require the use of any pressors in the micu. patient's cvp, urine output were followed and the goal cvp was between 12 and 14. on admission to the micu his cvp was between 7 and 8. his antibiotics were continued (ampicillin/levofloxacin/flagyl). in addition, lactate, bicarb, hematocrit, urine output were followed closely. the impression at this time was that patient had blood causing a blood clot which subsequently obstructed his biliary drainage, caused biliary fluid to back up causing ascending cholangitis and subsequent sepsis. after interventional radiology had intervened and upsized his biliary drainage tube, there were no more blood clots and the biliary catheter was patent with the bile being brown. the main question at this point in time was what caused the biliary bleeding. there was a question of whether it was tumor bleeding, some sort of tract between one of the portal vessels and the biliary tract, whether there was bleeding of the liver itself with anticoagulation. on the initial cholangiogram that was done there was a question of whether there was a biliary tract fistula with one of the pleural vessels. however, on cholangiogram done on [**2161-3-9**] any apparent fistulous tracts were not identified. this was discussed with the interventional radiology team and they felt that it was safe to anticoagulate patient for his pulmonary embolism. therefore, in the micu patient's anticoagulation was restarted with a heparin drip. on [**2161-3-10**] biliary drainage remained patent. bile was clear and green. white blood count began to decrease. in the medical intensive care unit it had risen to 38% and then to 43%. subsequently it began to decrease down to the lower 30s and then to the mid-20s. in addition, on [**2161-3-10**] alkaline phosphatase/total bilirubin/alt/ast began decreasing as well. blood cultures at this time showed initially a question of gram positive rods. on [**2161-3-10**] patient was stable to be transferred to the floor. on [**2161-3-11**] the patient's biliary catheter drainage tube became clogged again. biliary catheter appeared to be obstructed by a blood clot. interventional radiology came and examined the bag and it was flushed, but it still did not drain. patient's heparin was discontinued and patient was taken to interventional radiology for a tube check (cholangiogram) to check for effective drainage. on [**2161-3-11**] interventional radiology changed the biliary catheter and additionally identified a fistulous tract. a branch of the right hepatic artery was embolized. additionally, blood cultures that were drawn on [**2161-3-9**] returned as enterococcus with sensitivities and identifications still pending. on [**2161-3-12**] enterococcus was identified as enterococcus faecalis with sensitivities pending. patient's hematocrit was checked b.i.d. and remained relatively stable. there was a question of whether patient may need to have a repeat embolization if he continued to bleed or if there was another fistulous tract not identified. patient's coags were checked and inr was between 1.8 to 2.0, so he was not started on heparin and not started on lovenox. there was hesitancy to anticoagulate this patient to run the risk of causing rebleeding, reocclusion and reinfection. on [**2161-3-13**] the biliary stent was patent. bilirubin continued to decrease. lfts continued to decrease. levofloxacin was discontinued as the sensitivities from the cultures were back. it was enterococcus faecalis sensitive to ampicillin and resistant to levofloxacin as well as some synergy with streptomycin. adding streptomycin in addition to ampicillin as well as flagyl was considered, however, it was decided against secondary to the severe potential toxicity related to streptomycin. since the enterococcus was sensitive to ampicillin, this was the primary antibiotic. on [**2161-3-14**] the patient's hematocrit was checked b.i.d. vital signs were stable. inr was 1.8. no changes. on [**2161-3-15**] b.i.d. hematocrit was checked. vital signs were stable. inr was 1.4. on [**3-16**] through [**3-17**] patient's biliary drainage was capped by interventional radiology. a lovenox trial was initiated, in treatment of his pulmonary embolism. the lovenox trial was initiated to determine whether he would be able to tolerate anticoagulation. the thought was that if patient rebled on lovenox, patient would require an ivc filter for prevention of future pulmonary emboli. however, if patient did not rebleed on lovenox, it would be safe to consider patient tolerates lovenox and would be able to take this as an outpatient. the patient tolerated lovenox well during the two day trial. hematocrit was checked b.i.d. and there was no evidence of bleeding. in addition, his stools were guaiaced and there was no evidence of melena or bright red blood per rectum. it appeared that patient's prior episodes of bleeding while on heparin/lovenox were due to the fistulous tract between the branch of the right hepatic artery with the biliary tract. subsequent to his embolization on [**2161-3-11**], there had not been any apparent episodes of bleeding in his biliary drainage bag and it appeared that the source of the bleeding had stopped. on [**2161-3-18**] the patient went to interventional radiology to check the patency of his stent. cholangiogram revealed good patency of the stent and no communication between the biliary ducts and any vessels. the external tube/drainage was removed. the intrahepatic tract was embolized. only the internal stent remained. patient tolerated the procedure quite well. on [**2161-3-19**] patient resumed lovenox. a picc line was placed on the right side for iv antibiotics times 10 days. patient is to continue iv antibiotics (ampicillin only) for a 10 day treatment. he was discharged in good condition on [**2161-3-19**] to home with services. hospital course by issue: 1. pulmonary embolism. patient was readmitted to [**hospital1 18**] for pulmonary embolism. he was initially started on a heparin drip and subsequently switched to lovenox. at various points throughout the admission patient was either on heparin or lovenox, but these were sometimes held, as above. coumadin was not recommended as a form of anticoagulation secondary to his high bilirubin and the potential interactions with coumadin and capecitabine, should patient decide to pursue chemotherapy. patient's discharge medication is lovenox 90 mg subcu q.12 hours. [**name (ni) **] wife had lovenox teaching and she administered lovenox to patient with ease. 2. hematology. as above, anticoagulation with lovenox. in addition, patient had anemia secondary to acute blood loss requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells. 3. prophylaxis. the patient was placed on iv famotidine while he was not eating well. 4. gi. biliary obstruction and jaundice, status post percutaneous drain placement/common bile duct stenting. patient had numerous interventional radiology interventions as dictated above. 5. ascending cholangitis/sepsis. the patient was hypotensive (blood pressure 90/50) tachycardiac to 140, respiratory rate in the 30s, lactate 5.6. it appeared that patient had ascending cholangitis leading to sepsis. blood cultures as well as biliary culture revealed enterococcus faecalis sensitive to ampicillin, resistant to levofloxacin. after patient's final intervention with his common bile duct stent on wednesday, [**2161-3-18**], he is to have 10 days of iv antibiotics (ampicillin). 6. pancreatitis. the patient's amylase and lipase were checked serially throughout his admission. they have fluctuated widely, increasing and decreasing. there are several causative factors to his pancreatitis with post procedure pancreatitis being a contribution as well as the fact that patient has a very large tumor/mass at the head of the pancreas. there could also be some fluctuation as well secondary to a question of intermittent/transient obstruction in the ampulla. patient did not have any abdominal pain and denied abdominal tenderness. at this point in time since he is not symptomatic from the pancreatitis, there will be no further intervention (no ercp will be pursued). patient was discharged on a regular diet which he tolerated well. while he was in-house patient was hydrated aggressively with 125 cc of normal saline per hour while his enzymes were elevated. 7. neurology. head ct was without metastasis or hemorrhage. 8. renal. the patient's creatinine was within normal limits. 9. fluids, electrolytes and nutrition. the patient had iv fluids at 125 cc an hour for rehydration purposes while patient had decreased appetite. of note, patient does have occasional nausea and decreased p.o. intake as well as appetite. there was a question of whether this was secondary to iv flagyl. iv flagyl was discontinued on [**2161-3-19**]. hopefully, patient will have an increase in his appetite. it was decided that iv flagyl was not necessary and that the primary antibiotic would be ampicillin to target enterococcus. 10. access. the patient had a right picc line placed for iv antibiotics times 10 days. 11. pain. the patient was given morphine iv/subcu p.r.n. for pain. patient was discharged with a prescription for p.o. morphine. of note, patient does not have severe pain, but does have occasional back pain when he lays in bed too long. 12. oncology. the patient has pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma) with liver metastasis. in addition, tumor burden causes biliary obstruction as well. patient will follow up with an oncologist on [**location (un) **]. 13. communication. the patient's micu course as well as his hospital course were communicated to patient's pcp. [**name initial (nameis) **] pcp is [**last name (namepattern4) **]. [**first name4 (namepattern1) **] [**last name (namepattern1) **] ([**telephone/fax (1) 49945**]). discharge instructions: if the patient starts having bloody stools, fever greater than 100.5, fast heart rate greater than 110, chills/sweating or dizziness with standing/walking, please go to the nearest emergency department. condition on discharge: afebrile, hemodynamically stable. hematocrit is stable times four days (29 to 30) with two days on lovenox. no bloody stools. tolerating lovenox well. it appears that the fistula between the branch of the right hepatic artery and the biliary tract was the cause of the bleeding while on anticoagulation. the fistula has since been embolized and there appears to be no more evidence of bleeding. external biliary drain has been pulled and patient only has an internal drain with his common bile duct stent. since his last manipulation/intervention was on [**2161-3-18**], he should have 10 days of iv antibiotics given his past medical history of sepsis with enterococcus. he is discharged to home in good condition. followup: the patient should follow up with his pcp, [**last name (namepattern4) **]. [**first name (stitle) **], within the first week after being discharged back to [**location (un) **]. patient will follow up with oncology on [**location (un) **]. this was conveyed to dr.

[**last name (stitle) 74763**]. he had a generalized convulsion at the time, without any associated fever or illness. the eeg then apparently showed an abnormality in the left temporal region. he was treated briefly with phenobarbital. he remained seizure-free until he was 23 years old, when he had his second generalized seizure while he was driving on i-95. this was in [**2143**]. he recalls that he suddenly felt like he could control or focus his eyes, and the eyes were rolling back uncontrollably, with the arms becoming rigid within a second. he then lost consciousness. his father was in the car at the time and noted that he had a 15-minute episode of generalized limb shaking. luckily, this did not result in a car accident and the car eventually coasted to a stop. he was taken to a local hospital and dilantin 300 mg a day was started. about 3 years later in [**2146**], he had another generalized seizure, again while he was driving. he was taking dilantin at the time. he woke up in the car confused, and the police told him that he had witnessed seizure activity. his dilantin was increased to 400 mg at that time. he was well until [**2148**] when he had an episode of status epilepticus, in the setting of stress and sleep deprivation. within 1 hour, he had 2 episodes of 20-minute generalized seizure and another 10-minute episode. he was taken to [**hospital6 50929**]. after that, he noted significant cognitive problems with very poor memory and visuospatial skills. after this episode, he was tried on valproate, which did not work. lamictal was then added to the regimen, and ativan was also given for about 6 months. during this time, he continued to have occasional seizures, during which he would spontaneously lose his train of thought very briefly for a few seconds. he may also lose track of time for up to 5-10 minutes at a time. if he forgot to take his medications, he noted an intense nervous or flighty sensation, which would build for several hours. he denies any olfactory, gustatory, or auditory hallucinations. he denies any epigastric sensations or out of body experiences. in [**2152**], he moved to [**location 8398**]for his phd. he was under the care of [**first name5 (namepattern1) **] [**last name (namepattern1) 74763**] at [**hospital **] [**hospital 25757**] hospital. he was admitted to the inpatient epilepsy monitoring unit for about a week. the eeg showed left-sided slowing with epileptiform discharges. he eventually was weaned off the dilantin as he had been on it for quite a long time, and it was not quite effective for him. keppra was added in [**2153**]. he states that his last seizure was about 3 years ago, both in terms of the generalized seizures, as well as the occasional interruptions in his train of thought. he is currently doing well without any clear side effects. he continues to have memory difficulties, which he believes is a residual of the episode of status epilepticus in [**2148**]. he also has some difficulty with visual spatial abilities, and he may forget how to get into or out of a building. he states that he had formal cognitive testing with a neuropsychologist at [**hospital 25757**] hospital. he takes his medications three times daily and prefers tid to [**hospital1 **] dosing. this way, if he misses a dose, it is not a large amount. he is typically delayed with his medications and misses a dose once a week at most. aside from the medications above, he has not tried any other anticonvulsant. typical triggers for his seizures include stress and medication non-compliance. in terms of his epilepsy risk factors, his paternal aunt has generalized seizures, but he does not know the details. his [**hospital1 802**] had a non-febrile seizure at age 4 years old. he denies any history of cns infections, febrile seizures, or significant head injuries. developmental and birth history: as far as he knows, he was born full term via vaginal delivery, without complications. he met all of his developmental milestones and did well in school. past medical history: 1. hypercholesterolemia. 2. myopia. 3. malaria in [**2140**] when he was travelling to [**country 480**]. 4. kidney infection in [**2151**]. social history: he currently lives with his sister. [**name (ni) **] is single and has no children. he just completed his phd in anthropology at [**university/college **]. he is unemployed and in the process of looking for a job. he does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use drugs. family history: his mother has multiple sclerosis and mitral valve prolapse. his father has rapid heartbeat and stroke. his sister has no neurological problems. his [**name2 (ni) 802**] had a non-febrile seizure at age 4 years old. his paternal aunt has epilepsy as described above. alzheimer disease also seems to run in multiple paternal relatives. physical exam:

after a status epilepticus. at that time he were intubated for airway protection and admitted into our neurology icu. patient's episode of convulsive status epilepticus at least for 45 minutes by report. there was no clear trigger to this in that he was compliant with his medications and he was not ill at that time. a spinal tap was unremarkable and did not show any evidence of cns infection. there was no systemic infection as well after a thorough workup. his eeg telemetry showed left greater than right temporal lobe discharges interictally but no electrographic seizures. as patient was also having mood disturbance and that keppra can sometimes cause mood lability and psychiatric side effects, this was weaned off and replaced with trileptal. he did do well with the trileptal transition. for the episodes noted of status, he was loaded with dilantin and maintained on stable maintenance dose of 100 mg t.i.d. the lamictal remained the same. he remained stable for discharge on trileptal 600 mg t.i.d., lamictal 150 mg t.i.d., dilantin 100 mg. the dilantin can be tapered off per dr.

on presentation, the patient's presentation was assessed to meet criteria for sirs with a septic like picture on presentation. the patient was febrile, hypotensive with altered mental status in the setting of an anc of 590. while in the ed, the patient had cultures drawn, and was initially treated with cefepime, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and hydrocortisone. upon transfer to the micu, the patient was maintained on therapy with cefepime and vancomycin for treatment of febrile neutropenia. the patient had received 3l ns hydration initially and was given ffp with intention to reverse the patient's elevated inr (patient on coumadin for dvt) for possible lp. however, after hydration the patient's mental status was noted to significantly improve and an lp was not attempted at this time. the patient had a lactate of 1.8 with good response in blood pressure with hydration. overnight in the icu on the day of admission the patient had two episodes of hypotension, with systolics in the 60's to 70's range necessitating 2ns and 2lr boluses, again with good response. it was the impression of the treating attending oncologist that the patient's presentation and diarrhea was consistent with chemotherapy induced diarrhea rather than an infectious diarrhea. for this reason, the patient was started on anti-motility agents including lomotil and questran. however, these agents had little effect initially as the patient continued to have high volume diarrhea. in the 24 hours after admission, the patient was assessed to have a gi output of about 2800cc. the patient upon transfer to the floor had a rectal tube and foley in place. however, given that the patient had an anc < 1000 at that time, the decision was made that invasive catheters should likely be removed. as the patient has been largely incontinent of stool, it has been difficult objectively to quantify exact gi output. the patient reported that over the course of her hospital stay, she has not felt that there has been great improvement to date in the quantity of stool produced ,although she has reported increased continence. however, the day prior to discharge to receiving hospital, the patient endorses two to three liquid green bowel movements that she reports she was not even aware of until they had passed. the patient has not required fluid bolusing since trasnfer to the floor, but has been receiving constant iv hydration with ns with 20meq kcl requiring electrolyte repletion q12hr. the patient continues to have a significant non-gap acidosis secondary to diarrhea with serum bicarbonate levels of 11 to 14 over the last three days prior to discharge. however, an abg performed on [**2118-10-4**] as follows: po2-92 pco2-22* ph-7.40 calhco3-14* base xs--8 revealed that the patient is not acidemic and adequately compensating for her bicarbonate loss. as the patient has had a normal serum ph she has not been receiving oral or iv bicarbonate but continues to receive hydration and volume repletion with ns at 125 to 175 cc/hr. as the patient continues to have significant gi output, she will require ongoing hydration and additionally should receive electrolyte panels with repletion q12hrs until no longer needed. in an attempt to decrease the patient's gi output, in addition to lomotil and questran which were initiated on admission, the patient has serially been given kaopectate and the day prior to discharge was started on octreotide and metamucil to help bulk her very liquidy green stool. the patient has now been afebrile > 48 hours, and is currently receiving still cefepime 2gm iv q8hr, now day 8 (started [**2118-9-29**]) and flagyl which was initiated in place of vancomycin (now day 4, initiated [**2118-10-3**]). as the patient has been afebrile for > 48 hours consideration may be made towards discontinuing these medications but will be left to the discretion of the receiving hospital. the patient has had multiple stool and blood cultures sent during this admission (see pertinent results) which have demonstrated mild to moderate leukocytes in the stool but cultures, o+p and c. diff have been negative multiple times. as the patient reported some mild llq tenderness a ct of the abdomen was obtained to detect any occult abscess or other infectious process. ct results demonstrated soft tissue density a the site of the patient's known prior pancreatic mass but revealed no abnormal large or small bowel loop dilatation. ct demonstrated many of the small bowel loops to be mildly prominent, measuring up to 3 cm in diameter and revealed the [**month/day/year 499**] to be fluid filled throughout, thought to be related to the patient's ongoing enteritis. in the pelvis ct additionally revealed a small 2 cm fluid attenuating locule in the posterior inferior pelvis. the patient is now being transferred to receiving hospital for ongoing management of patient's diarrhea and electroylte abnormalities. . #. dvt - the patient on admission was being treated with 2.5mg po qhs of coumadin qhs for known dvt diagnosed in 08-[**2117**]. the patient's inr on presentation was 3.4 which was partially reversed with 1u ffp in anticipation of possible lp. however, as above, given reversal of somnolence with volume rescucitation alone, an lp was not performed. the patient's coumadin was held throughout her stay as she continued to have a supratherapeutic inr without coumadin, thought likely to be secondary to her poor po intake as well as extinguishing gut flora with antibiotics. the patient's inr was 6.0 on [**2118-10-2**] for which she received 2.5mg po vitamin k with good effect, and reduction of her inr to 4.2 the next day. the patient in error however was given a dose of 2.5mg coumadin x1 despite a holding order the following day. her inr was again elevated to 6.3 the day prior to discharge. as the patient's inr was greater than 5, but without any evidence of any ongoing bleeding, the patient's coumadin continues to be held and an addiitional 2.5mg po vitamin k was administered. the patient's inr the am of discharge was found to be 7.0. the patient was given 5mg vitamin k sc this am with concern that previous po doses are not being well absorbed given the patients rapid gi transit time. of additional note, the patient has been noted previously and again this am to have occasional schistocytes on peripheral blood smear. a fibrinogen level checked previously was 543 on [**2118-10-3**] and repeat fibrinogen am of discharge, [**2118-10-6**] was 418, not consistent with dic. the patient should continue to have her inr carefully monitored at the receiving hospital with consideration towards additional vitamin k sc/iv for reversal of inr > 5.0 or ffp with any signs of bleeding. . #. access - in the icu on admission, the patient's port was noted to be not functioning properly. a flow study was performed which demonstrated fluid flow proximal to the catheter tip suggestive likely of a fibrin sheath vs. a possible catheter leak. the port was used once on the floor prior to the results of the flow study being revealed and the patient reported some burning at the port entry site with the infusion of some fluids with potassium. therefore, the port has not been used again during this hospital course and the port should not be used any longer. the patient's port likely will have to be removed given it is not functional. plans were to be made to have the port removed now that the patient has been afebrile > 48hours and hemodynamically stable. upon transfer to the receiving hospital, plans will need to continue to be initiated towards port removal or alternatively attempts could be made to have an attempted snare by interventional radiology for removal of a fibrin sheath if present. the patient is aware the port is not functional and aware it will likely need to be removed. . #. pancreatic ca: as discussed in h+p, the patient is currently s/p distal pancreatectomy, left adrenal/nephrectomy, ometectomy treated additionally with xrt and xeloda, follwed by gemcitabine/cisplatin, and most recently treated with xeloda/irinotecan s/p two 3-week cycles. the patient was travelling to [**location (un) 86**] for second opinion regarding treatment options when she developed severe diarrhea and hypotension. given the patient's apparent chemo toxicity, chemo was held currently until patient is medically stable to continue. impression of oncologist seeing patient at [**hospital1 18**] is that of the two agents, the xeloda may be more responsible for the treatment response to date and the irinotecan her current gi toxicity. given this, considerations towards additional chemo included xeloda alone, possibly with the addition of low dose irinotecan if tumor markers began to rise again. alternatively, patient could additioanlly receive folfox or taxotere as well. the patient is being discharged to receiving hospital currently with plans towards continuing management of diarrhea, electrolyte abnormalities as outlined above and will continue treatment planning with regards to her pancreatic ca with her oncologist. . #. htn - given patient's admission for hypotension, her outpatient regimen of propranolol was held during her hospital course. upon resolution of large gi output and decreased need for iv volume sresuscitation, consideration could be made towards reinitiating patient's antihypertesnive regimen. . #. fen- patient was kept on a low fat, lactose free brat diet with supplemental pancrease given. patient's po intake was not optimal during hospital course, but continues to improve with resolution of her symptoms. . #. communication: patient's significant other, [**name (ni) **] may be reached at [**telephone/fax (1) 62493**].; he is very supportive and intimately involved in the patient's care. medications on admission: medications -

to be rapid atrial fibrillation and was loaded with intravenous amiodarone. the [**hospital 228**] [**hospital3 **] course is also notable for a 2 unit packed red blood cell transfusion for a hematocrit of 24 in the setting of guaiac positive stools and an inr of greater then 8.0. review of symptoms: fatigue, malaise, chest pain centered around the pacemaker insertion as well as dyspnea on exertion, stable three pillow orthopnea and stable lower extremity edema. the patient denies any paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or syncope. past medical history: coronary artery disease status post right coronary artery cypher stent on [**10/2120**] (one vessel disease). peripheral vascular disease status post axillobifemoral bypass graft [**2121-5-6**]. childhood [**last name (un) 12132**]

cholangiopancreatography demonstrated a common bile duct dilatation/stricture. she is status post sphincterotomy. cirrhosis noted incidentally on mr of [**2-27**]. the patient is hepatitis b and c seronegative. etiology of the cirrhosis is not known. status post cholecystectomy. atrophic left kidney. barrett's esophagus. gastroesophageal reflux disease/hiatal hernia. colonic polyps. oa. anxiety/panic attacks. breast cancer status post left mastectomy. suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that is 4.2 cm in size. as mentioned the patient is status post ddd pacemaker placement on the [**2121-5-12**] for complete heart block. medications on transfer: 1. ceftriaxone 1 gram intravenously q day. 2. aspirin 81. 3. lopressor 5 intravenously q 6. 4. protonix. 5. regular insulin sliding scale. 6. vancomycin q 48 hours. 7. intravenous heparin. social history: the patient does not smoke. she denies current ethanol use. denies any ivda. the patient lives alone. family history: the patient is adopted and family history is noncontributory. physical examination on admission: temperature 98.9, blood pressure 105/48, heart rate 90, respiratory rate 27 with an o2 sat of 98 percent on 4 liters. the patient is found lying flat in bed breathing comfortably in no acute distress, anicteric. conjunctiva are uninjected. pupils are equal, round and reactive to light. extraocular movements intact. mucous membranes are moist. there are no sores or lesions in the oropharynx. there is no jugular venous distension in the upright position. the patient has an irregular rhythm with a grade 2 out of 6 holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex radiating to the axilla. there is a normal s1 and s2. no s3 or s4 are appreciated. the patient has bilateral crackles one half of the way up. abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended. positive bowel sounds. she has 1 plus pitting edema bilaterally. she has 1 plus dorsalis pedis pulses and trace posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. there are no rashes noted and no stigmata of endocarditis appreciated on examination. neurological examination mental status the patient is alert, oriented times three. she has a flat affect. cranial nerve examination is notable for moderate hearing loss, otherwise unremarkable. upper and lower extremity strength 4 to 5 plus and symmetric bilaterally. normal cerebellar examination. gait is not tested. laboratories on admission: sodium 130, potassium 8.7, chloride 95, bicarb 21, bun 58 creatinine 2.1, glucose 248, white blood cell count 5 with a hematocrit of 28 and platelets of 86. electrocardiogram demonstrates a paced rhythm with atrial premature complexes, left atrial abnormality, left bundle branch block with an intraventricular conduction delay. hospital course: 1. infectious disease: as mentioned above the patient was noted to have a high grade bacteremia from cultures drawn at the [**hospital3 **] prior to admission. surveillance cultures following transfer continued to reveal high grade bacteremia with 2 out of 4 bottles that were positive on the 15th for gram positive cocci. they were identified as mrsa. the patient was continued on intravenous vancomycin on a renally dosed basis. given the discomfort around her pacemaker site as well as fluctuance at the pacemaker site, as well as her frequent arrhythmia the electrophysiology service was consulted. subsequent ecg on the [**5-11**] showed what was likely to be a wide complex tachycardia with a left bundle branch block, superior axis with av dissociation consistent with ventricular tachycardia. she was subsequently noted to have multiple prolonged runs of wide complex tachycardia of 10 to 30 beats on telemetry. interrogation of pacemaker demonstrated multiple runs of ventricular tachycardia. chest film demonstrated that the a lead is well placed and the v lead had become dislodged. subsequent fluoroscopy revealed that the v lead was dislodged and located in the rvot (had been placed in the rva). the decision was made to remove the pacemaker given lead dislodgement and also about of concern for likely pacemaker infection. an incision was made over the generator and a moderate amount of brown fluid was expressed from the pocket. fluid was sent for studies and revealed involvement with mrsa. pocket was extensively irrigated with antibiotic solution (gentamycin and vancomycin) and was debrided of necrotic appearing tissue. a penrose drain was placed in the wound and the tissue was approximated, but not closed. out of concern for possible endocarditis given the combination of high grade mrsa bacteremia, likely infected pacer wire, which is present in the rv and rvot as well as newly appreciated mr murmur, the patient underwent transesophageal echocardiogram, which did reveal mild to moderate mitral regurgitation as well as moderate mitral annular calcification. an echogenic mass was seen at the base of the posterior mitral valve leaflet consistent with a calcified annulus, however, a vegetation in his region could not be fully excluded. given the history of groin infection that included involvement with mrsa shortly after the axillobifemoral graft was placed as well as the high grade mrsa bacteremia, the patient was taken for mr of the torso to ascertain whether the axillobifemoral graft might be infected. the mri revealed the graft is patent with patent proxima and distal anastomosis though with a large amount of fluid along entire extent of the graft that is up to 3 cm in transverse diameter in portions. the fluid is contained within an enhancing capsule that is highly concerning for infectious involvement. the patient is to undergo ultrasound guided diagnostic tap of this perigraft fluid on the [**5-18**]. the patient's surveillance cultures had been negative since the [**5-12**] through the time of this dictation summary. the patient also complained of low back pain and again given the history of high grade mrsa bacteremia the patient underwent mr of the l spine. although initially the mri was concerning for l5 s1 facet joint septic arthritis and possible associated epidural abscess a subsequent review of the mri with both neurosurgery and infectious disease consult as well as with radiology revealed a very low level of suspicion for either septic arthritis or epidural abscess. serial physical examinations were followed and there was no evidence of cord compression through the time of this dictation summary. the patient has remained afebrile for several days prior to the end of the period covered by this dictation summary. the patient has also had multiple episodes with diarrhea. three c-diff tox and asas have been negative. additional stool studies are pending at the time of this dictation summary. 1. arrythmia: as mentioned above the patient was transferred from the outside hospital with concern for possible rapid atrial fibrillation. however, further studies revealed dislodgement of the ventricular pacemaker lead and displacement into the rvot. it is felt that the arrhythmia that was noted prior to transfer and just after transfer were likely caused by this malfunctioning lead, which stimulated a burst of wide complex tachycardia. the pacemaker was removed on the [**5-11**]. the patient's amiodarone was discontinued and the patient was maintained on telemetry in the cardiac intensive care unit. the patient's status is also followed with daily ecgs. she was noted to have frequent episodes of sinus beats followed by blocked apcs. after pauses caused by the blocked apcs she was noted to have inappropriate qt prolongation of up to over 600 milliseconds and on several occasions underwent a torsad like nonsustained ventricular tachycardia of up to five beats. the patient was also noted on several electrocardiograms to have inappropriate qt prolongation. the patient's potassium and magnesium were aggressively repleated with a goal potassium greater then 4.5 and a goal magnesium greater then 2.5. the patient's ssri was titrated off. the patient was maintained on beta blocker and the dose of beta blocker was titrated upwards to help prevent phase three blocking. out of concern for reinfection of even a temporary pacemaker wire the patient was maintained on telemetry without reinsertion of pacing wire and remained hemodynamically stable even during the short burst of torsad like nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. 1. coronary artery disease: the patient was maintained on aspirin, ace inhibitor and lipitor. she was noted to have dynamic t wave changes on several ecgs, though remained chest pain free throughout. of note the patient was noted to have a positive troponin t on admission. although her ck maximum is 111 on the [**5-10**] troponin t was .32 and subsequently 0.35 on the [**5-11**]. however, on transesophageal echocardiogram left ventricular wall motion was normal with an ef of 65 percent and rv wall motion was likewise normal. 1. congestive heart failure: the patient was noted to have significant pulmonary edema on physical examination on admission. she was gently diuresed and rapidly improved to the point that she was stable with o2 sats in the upper 90s on room air. 1. right sided visual loss: the patient complained of partial right sided visual defect several days into the hospital course. these visual defects were quite concerning to the team for possible stigmata of endocarditis. the defects are further concerning as the patient is maintained on anticoagulation for her bypass graft and had an elevated inr of greater then 8 prior to admission. an mr of the head did not demonstrate any evidence for septic emboli, although there was concern for a small (.5 cm) subdural hematoma in the right occipital region. however, subsequent ct did not demonstrate any intra or extracranial hemorrhage. an ophthalmology consultation was obtained and a dilated examination was performed. the patient was observed to have had a small retinal hemorrhage. the hemorrhage was thought to be unrelated to the mrsa infection and was felt to be self limited. the patient's visual examination was noted to be stable on subsequent serial examinations. 1. diabetes mellitus: the patient was continued on a humalog sliding scale and her dose of q.h.s. glargine was titrated upwards. 1. depression: the patient was continued on her outpatient dose of sertraline. the dose was initially increased from 25 mg q day to 50 mg q day, though when the patient had qt prolongation of uncertain etiology the patient's sertraline was discontinued. 1. pancytopenia: the patient was noted to have pancytopenia on admission. this had previously been attributed to a possible adverse reaction to nexium. the patient does, however, have a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease as well as barrett's esophagus and was maintained on an h2 blocker rather then protonix or nexium. the patient's white blood cell, hematocrit and platelet count all increased over the period of this dictation. 1. acute renal failure: the patient was noted to have arf on admission with a creatinine of 2.1 on admission. this is a significant increase from her baseline at 0.9 to 1.0. however, her creatinine subsequently improved serially to a level of 0.9 on the [**5-15**]. this dictation summary will cover the hospital course through the [**5-17**]. the remainder of the [**hospital 228**] hospital course will be dictated subsequently.

[**2198-5-25**] echo conclusions: no thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. the interatrial septum is aneurysmal, but no atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2d or color doppler. overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (lvef>55%). [intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] right ventricular systolic function is normal. the ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. no masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. trace aortic regurgitation is seen. there is a large (1.6 x 1.5 cm) vegetation on the posterior mitral leaflet, with leaflet perforation. an associated jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. the anterior mitral leaflet is normal in appearance, and there is no associated mitral annular abscess. no vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve and tricuspid valve. impression: mitral valve endocarditis with posterior leaflet perforation. severe mitral regurgitation. . [**2198-5-28**] pelvis ultrasound this is a technically difficult examination. the transabdominal study is very limited due to the patient's body habitus. endovaginal examination was also technically difficult. the uterus measures 4 cm in transverse x 4.7 cm in ap x 6.5 cm in sagittal dimensions. the endometrial stripe measures 5 mm in maximum dimension. multiple heterogenous areas are identified within the uterus in the mid body which may represent fibroids. the largest of these measures less than 2 cm. the ovaries are not visualized. impression: technically difficult abdominal and transvaginal examinations in patient with normal endometrial stripe thickness and heterogenous appearance of uterus which may represent fibroids. ovaries not imaged. . [**2198-5-28**] doppler liver color & pulsed doppler son[**name (ni) **] liver: normal flow and waveforms are demonstrated within the hepatic arteries. no portal venous flow is identified within the main portal vein and the main portal vein is not well delineated. impression: 1) heterogeneous echotexture of the liver consistent with cirrhosis. no focal mass lesion identified. 2) the portal vein is not well delineated on this study. no color flow or doppler pulse is present within the expected region of the portal vein. chronic portal vein thrombus cannot be excluded. 3) cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. . repeat echo [**2198-6-7**] no significant changes from prior. . brief hospital course: this is a 62 yo pt with autoimmune hepatitis on chronic immunosuppression transferred from osh, with group b strep bacteremia, septic brain emboli, endopthalmitis, endocarditis with large mitral valve vegetation and small perforation. # endocarditis/bacteremia: the patient was initially on vancomycin and gentamycin when transferred, and placed on the sepsis protocol. as per id, gentamycin was discontinued and then was switched to penicillin 3 million units q 4 hours iv after desensitization in the micu without adverse reaction. pt was afebrile while in house, with no growth from blood cultures in house. vitreous fluid grew group b strep sensitive to vancomycin and penicillin. id followed the patient and she must remain on antibiotics for a minimum of six weeks. on id follow up on the [**6-19**], they will determine the total treatment length. a picc line was placed on [**2198-6-1**]. . # mitral valve damage: given bacteremia and probable septic emboli, as well as likely mitral vegetation on outside hospital tte, tee was performed [**5-25**]. this revealed large mitral valve vegetation with perforation and severe mitral regurgitation. cardiac surgery was immediately consulted. they followed the patient and determined she was not a surgery candidate given her multiple risk factors, including her childs b/c classification. the patient was started on lasix 20 mg po daily, and a low dose of lisinopril. her beta blocker was increased, and she tolerated these changes well until an episode of low bp(see below). prior to discharge, her nadolol was again reduced to 10 mg [**hospital1 **] and tapered off due to decreased low pressure in the setting of steroid taper. she developed hypotension 70s/doppler on [**6-6**], which did not respond appropriately to 1.5 l fluid bolus plus one unit prbcs. she was put back on stress dose steroids, all bp meds were d/c and new blood cultures were sent, with no growth. the next day, a new echo was ordered out of concern for cardiogenic shock. the results were similar to the previous one. she never became febrile or tachycardic. on [**6-7**], bp was 100s/doppler and the patient continued to be asymptomatic. she compalined of intermittent atypical chest pain, and several ekg revealed no ischemic changes. she needs to be on afterload reduction ideally, consisting of bb, ace-i and lasix, however due to her blood pressure running in the 100's systolic without any symptoms, these medications were stopped and should slowly be added back as blood pressure tolerates. patient is clinically hypervolemic with le edema and jvd, however no evidence of pulmonary fluid overload on exam. . # embolic stroke: mri/mra outside hospital with evidence of punctate lesions likely septic emboli. pt was on heparin at outside hospital, but given risk of hemorrhagic bleed into emboli, it was discontinued upon presentation to the [**hospital1 18**]. neurology followed the patient in house. she was disoriented at times but this was more consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and depression. she did not develop any neuro deficits. ct head repeated with no evidence of acute bleed. . #endophtalmitis: the patient presented with hypopyon and complete vision loss. she underwent tap and aspiration, but not vitrectomy, liquid growing strep b, and had antibiotics injected directly into the chamber: vancomycin and cefepime. ophto followed closely and they deem the r eye not salvageable. evisceration versus enucleation was planned, however the patient wished to wait. in the meantime, she was continued on eye drops recommended by ophto (see medication list). she must protect her remaining eye at all times. she has been arranged for follow up with ophto. . #hyperkalemia and hyponatremia- no evidence of adrenal failure. with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, there was concern for adrenal insufficiency, though patient was on stress dose steroids, which were subsequently tapered to 10 mg daily iv, then started po on 80 mg, tapered down to 20 mg po daily, final goal 5 mg every other day. pharmacy was consulted about penicillin with ~30 meq daily potassium, but they did not feel that this could cause persistent hyperkalemia. the patient was previously on k sparing diuretic spironolactone which was held. the patient required [**hospital1 **] lyte checks for a few days and several doses of kayexelate. the hyperkalemia resolved 8 days prior to discharge, also in the setting of increased insulin. hyponatremia persists, and is consistent with adh derangements with concentrated urine osmolality. the patient was placed on free water restriction 1.5 liter daily. . #thrombocytopenia- platelets decreased during admission, but remained above 50 except for a value in the 40s on [**6-12**]. low platelets are in the setting of cirrhosis with compromised synthetic function (albumin 1.5). she received vitamin k sq x 3 doses. hit was positive, but serotonin release antibody was negative, therefore the patient was continued on sq heparin with no evidence of decreased platelet count or thrombosis. small amount of vaginal bleeding during admission, which resolved. . #cirrhosis: egd demonstarted grade i varices. the hepatology service followed the patient. imuran was held. nadolol was re-started at 10 [**hospital1 **], then increased to 20 [**hospital1 **]. the bb was subsequently decreased again to 10 mg in the setting of low blood pressures. aldactone was held with the development of hyperkalemia. the patient developed hepatic encephalopathy with asterixis and lactulose was begun and titrated to 3 bm daily, with the patient's mental status improving. the patient developed worsening unconjugated bilirubinemia with some evidence of hemolysis. bilirubin then trended down (although it remains elevated). transaminases remained normal with a mild elevation the last few days. hepatology started rifaximin on [**6-7**]. per hepatology, imuran can be restarted if lfts double. taper of prednisone can continue while watching her lfts. she should continue on 20 mg prednisone daily for [**6-13**] and [**6-14**] and then be decreased to 10 mg daily to be continued indefinitely. . #hemodynamics: the patient blood pressure became low on [**6-5**] and [**6-6**]. on [**6-6**], she triggered for bp 78/doppler. she was clammy on exam but not lightheaded or diaphoretic. that same day, her hct<25 with no significant bleeding (she had persistent hematuria throughout admission, insufficient to explain her hct drop). she was treated with 1500 cc ns and transfused one unit, without adequate response. she was started on stress dose hydrocortisone. after transfusion, the hct was appropriately 2 points higher. blood cultures were sent, which were negative. the next day, an echo showed no changes from prior. bp was 100s/doppler and an ekg was obtained as described above, with no ischemic changes. the patient's blood pressure stabilized and she was again placed on steroid taper 2 days later. discharge bp was 100/50, which is consistent with patient's baseline bp. . #hyperglycemia: initially the patient's sugars were 200-300s. lantus dose was increased to 32 units, then 34 and 36, and humalog as well as sliding scale was successively tightened. at discharge, the finger sticks were significantly improved, and the lantus dose is again decreased in setting of steroid taper. . #depression: initially, all psychotropic medications were held due to the patient's poor mentation in the setting of bacteremia and possibly hepatic encephalopathy. the patient's sensorium cleared significantly with treatment, however her mood became increasingly depressed. the patient endorsed feelings of hopelesness, helplessness, and deep depression. celexa was restarted on [**6-11**]. . #vaginal bleeding: the patient developed mild vaginal bleeding with stable crit. she had had a normal gyn exam and pap 4 months prior to admission. gyn was consulted and examination revealed dark blood at the cervical os. they recommend that the patient have an endometrial biopsy as an outpatient. . #funguria: two successive urine cultures revealed yeast. a decision was made to institute a short course of fluconazole (last day [**2198-6-6**]) given the patient's immunosppression. an attempt was made to d/c foley, but the patient became unable to void, and the foley was reinstituted. a spontaneous voiding trial on 5/ 5/ 07 again resulted in the patient being unable to void, therefore the foley remains in place at discharge. the patient had at all times a normal neuro exam and specifically, she did not have saddle anesthesia. . #adl: pt and ot evaluated the patient and the consensus is that she is significantly below baseline and has excellent rehab potential. the patient is severely deconditioned and has difficulty ambulating at discharge. . #fen: diabetic, cardiac diet . #ppx: ssi while on steroids, ppi, heparin sq. . #code: full . #[**name (ni) **] husband at [**telephone/fax (1) 62006**] . #dispo- to rehab. medications on

[**hospital3 10310**] hospital with severe bilateral pneumonia, now known to be legionella based on urinary ag from osh and respiratory culture findings. . 1. respiratory failure: pt was in ards on admission and hypoxemic. had been intubated at the osh but was difficult to ventilate and required paralytics to get her to breathe in sync with the ventilator. she was paralyzed with cisatrucurium for one day, then paralysis was lightened as the patient was able to work with the vent. she was kept on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for presumed community-acquired pneumonia until the urinary legionella ag from the osh came back positive. ceftriaxone was then discontinued, and the patient completed a 14 day course of azithromycin for legionella pneumonia. for sedation, she was on versed and fentanyl which both needed to be escalated to keep her sedated. after a week, she was switched over to propofol for better sedation and to prevent further escalation of fentanyl/versed. she was volume overloaded throughout the course of her ards due to acute renal failure requiring 3 days of hemodialysis. once the arf resolved, she began to mobilize fluids on her own and diurese. with diuresis, her oxygenation began to improve and she was able to tolerate extended trials of pressure support. she was given boluses of lasix, then a lasix gtt, to enhance her diuresis with the goal being extubation. she was extubated on [**2147-6-28**] and did well for the first twelve hours. however, at approximately 2am, her o2 sats began to drop on 4l nc and she became tachypneic with a rr in the 50s. she was placed on facemask, then a nrb to keep her sats in the 90s. a cxr was taken at the time and looked like she was in chf. her abg at the time was 7.41/45/152 so she was kept on 100% fm and given 40mg lasix iv. attempts were made at noninvasive interventions with further diuresis and a trial of bipap but the patient began to tire and she was reintubated to improve her respiratory status. ekg and cardiac enzymes were negative, excluding a cardiac cause for her decompensation. a ct scan was negative for pe, but did show moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis. she also had thicker sputum, a fever, and an elevated white count, concerning for perhaps a vap. empiric antibiotic therapy was started (piptazo, levaquin, and vanco). once reintubated, her sedation was kept light and the patient was able to maintain her oxygenation on settings of ac 500x12, .4, and 10 of peep. she was very sensitive to the peep, leading us to believe that the etiology for her desaturation after extubation was decruitment of some critical number of her alveloi, causing atelectasis and an inability to maintain her oxygentation. she was given boluses of lasix to aid her diuresis, with the goal of being net negative 2l each day. the pt continued to have fevers and a urine culture showed probable enterococcus. ciprofloxacin 500mg [**hospital1 **] was started. sedation was decreased and the patient was extubated on the [**7-7**]. the patient tolerated the extubation well and did not have any further supplemental oxygen requirements. the patient remained afebrile and the course of ciprofloxacin was terminated after 5 days. would recommend that patient get a cxr as an outpatient following discharge to ensure that pneumonia has fully cleared. clinical exam on discharge suggests that pneumonia has resolved. . 2. acid base disorders: initially the patient was acidemic with a primary respiratory acidosis. she then developed an anion gap metabolic acidosis (felt to be due to lactate) and a nongap metabolic acidosis (due to fluid resuscitation and renal failure). she was put on a bicarb gtt to correct her acidosis with good effect on her ph, but due to volume overload, it could not be continued. her ph normalized with hemodialysis and then became alkalemic after her first extubation, likely due to a contraction alkalosis during diuresis. the alkalosis resolved after extubation. however, prior to discharge her labs were suggestive of a metabolic acidosis and alkalosis. this was thought to be related to the initiation of hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure control. hctz was therefore stopped and it is recommended that patient's primary care physician address the best intervention for blood pressure control. . 3. tachycardia: she was tachycardic on presentation, but it resolved with treatment of her hypoxia. she was intermittently tachycardic throughout the hospital course, but usually only in the settings of agitation, fever or respiratory distress. . 4. bp management: she was hypotensive on admission and required levophed until [**6-20**]. she remained normotensive for the remainder of her hospital course, except for periods of acute agitation or respiratory distress when she would become acutely hypertensive. on admission, many attempts were made to place an a-line in either of her wrists, and eventually anesthesia was able to get a line access in her l radial artery. she had multiple ecchymoses from these attempts on both of her forearms. once her original a line was lost, she had an a line placed in her r dorsalis pedis artery and then her r radial artery. bp normalized without any further fluid therapy and the pt tolerated the diureses of 2-3l daily well. once extubated the patient developed hypertension and was started on hctz 12.5mg po daily. as mentioned above, this was stopped secondary to acid-base abnormalities and we recommend that hypertension be addressed on an outpatient basis. . 5. sodium balance: she was hyponatremic on admission with a na of 128, thought to be due to the legionella infection. it slowly resolved with fluid resuscitation, until she became hypernatremic and hyperchloremic. free water boluses were added to her tf to correct her hypernatremia, but were discontinued in light of her volume status. they were restarted after she became reintubated at 250ml q4 until her na came down to 145. sodium levels remained within normal levels with diureses and no free water boluses were required. . 6. leukocytosis: she had a leukocytosis on presentation, likely due to her pneumonia. it was also compounded by steroids as she failed her [**last name (un) 104**]-stim test and was treated with 7 days of hydrocortisone and florinef for adrenal insufficiency, (last day was [**6-24**]). the only microbiology culture which ever grew a positive result was her respiratory culture from [**6-16**] which grew gram negative rods, thought to be legionella. the final result is still pending as it was sent to the state lab. all other cultures results (stool, sputum, urine, and blood) were negative. antibiotics were started on her reintubation for empiric therapy of a vent-associated pneumonia. however, she developed a drug rash and a fever while on those abx (first piptazo, then cefepime), so all abx were discontinued as the probability of her having a vap causing her reintubation was very low. the patient continued to have fevers and a urine culture was positive for enterococcus. ciprofloxacin was given for five days. the fever resolved and the patient remained afebrile. . 7. arf: her cr was 1.3 on admission and peaked at 5.1. her renal failure was thought to be due to atn [**1-4**] hypotension while septic. while in arf, she was virtually anuric and became volume overloaded with increasking k, increasing ph, low ph, and difficulty making progress with the ventilator. she was initially unresponsive to lasix and thus a quenten catheter was placed in her r femoral artery for hemodialysis. she was on hd for three days and tolerated it very well without any episodes of hypotension. after hd, she began to make her own urine and appeared to be in post-atn diuresis. lasix was given, iv and as a gtt, to assist in diuresis with good effect. after her reintubation, she required a ct scan with contrast to r/o a pe and we attempted to protect her kidneys with bicarb ivf and mucomyst. her cr did not bump post-scan, and her urine output continued to be 1-2l per day. the cr came down to 0.9 and the patient was diuresing well. however, prior to discharge her cr was ranging from 1.1-1.2. her baseline is likely much lower and there is likely some element of renal dysfunction secondary to her prolonged illness and hospital course. it is recommended that her lab values be followed up as an outpatient. . 8. hyperglycemia: the patient was placed on an insulin gtt during the acute phase of her illness to maintain tight glycemic control while she was critically ill. she had no h/o dm, and as her illness resolved, she was able to be weaned to a riss with good results. fs were typically within 100s-140s. . 9. anemia: the patient had a macrocytic anemia on presentation. hemolysis labs were negative, b12 and folate were high. likely etiology is etoh-induced. our goal for mrs. [**known lastname 63809**] was to keep her hct above 24. she required two transfusions, one unit of prbc on [**6-21**] and one unit on [**6-29**]. she tolerated both transfusions well without any signs or symptoms of fever, chills, or adverse reactions. she did not require any further transfusions. anemia had improved on discharge. . 10. transaminitis: on admission, she had ast>alt and alk phos 120, felt to be due to etoh use. the ratio of her lfts then changed, with alt>ast and alk phos becoming even higher. the etiology of her transaminitis is unclear. [**name2 (ni) 3539**] is 0.4 and patient does not appear jaundiced, so likely not obstructive. on exam, she had no hepatosplenomegaly or abdominal pain. most likely cause was medication, as lfts continued to trend downward with the resolution of her illness and removal of many of her medications. a ruq ultrasound during her admission reveladed a fatty liver but no evidence of biliary pathology. lfts should be followed up on an outpatient basis to ensure that they continue to trend downward. . 11. neuro status: on presentation, mrs. [**known lastname 63809**] was unresponsive but on high doses of sedation, analgesia, and paralytics. when the medication was weaned down, her mental status did not improve, her pupils were asymmetric and sluggish, and she appeared to have upgoing toes bilaterally and hyperreflexia on the right. a ct of her head was done to assess for intracranial pathology and it was negative. her sedation was changed to propofol as she began to develop a tolerance to fentanyl and versed and required higher doses to achieve adequate sedation. once weaned to propofol, it seemed that her neuro status improved. she was able to follow commands and interact more appropriately. on extubation, she asked appropriate questions and was able to be oriented. she was awake, alert and appropriate. her family reports that she is not quite at her baseline mental status. we would recommend following this closely and evaluating further if she does not return to her baseline in the near future. . 12. fen: the patient had an ogt placed during her admission and received tube feeds at goal of 40cc/hr. had difficulty with diarrhea at start of illness, but stool cx for c diff were negative. the patient was switched to po intake after extubation and tolerated it well. given patient's significant etoh history the patient should be continued on thiamine and folate. . 13. code status: full code . 14. communication: with husband [**name (ni) **], daughter [**name (ni) 23829**] . medications on admission: aspirin for headache dristan cold medicine discharge medications: 1. folic acid 1 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 2. thiamine hcl 100 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 3. lorazepam 1 mg tablet sig: 1-4 tablets po q4-6h (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for anxiety. 4. ipratropium bromide 18 mcg/actuation aerosol sig: six (6) puff inhalation q4-6h (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed. discharge disposition: extended care facility: [**hospital **] medical center - [**hospital1 3597**] discharge diagnosis: pneumonia discharge condition: stable discharge instructions: please discharge patient to [**hospital **] medical center. followup instructions: please follow up with your pcp after leaving rehabilitation. your physician should check [**name initial (pre) **] chest xray and labs to make sure everything has returned to [**location 213**].

change in the ability to move or use your leg or the ability to feel your leg ?????? temperature greater than 100.5f for 24 hours ?????? bleeding, new or increased drainage from incision or white, yellow or green drainage from incisions open wound: vac dressing patient's discharge instructions introduction: this will provide helpful information in caring for your wound. if you have any questions or concerns please talk with your doctor or nurse. you have an open wound, as opposed to a closed (sutured or stapled) wound. the skin over the wound is left open so the deep tissues may heal before the skin is allowed to heal. premature closure or healing of the skin can result in infection. your wound was left open to allow new tissue growth within the wound itself. the wound is covered with a vac dressing. this will be changed around every three days. the vac helps keep the wound tissue clean, absorbs drainage, prevents premature healing of skin, and promotes appropriate healing. when to call the doctor: watch for the following signs and symptoms and notify your doctor if these occur: temperature over 101.5 f or chills foul-smelling drainage or fluid from the wound increased redness or swelling of the wound or skin around it increasing tenderness or pain in or around the wound followup instructions: your vascular surgery followup appointment: provider: [**name10

elective admission for desensitization. she was admitted to the icu for closer observation whilst undergoing desensitization. she has had 3 reactions to rituximab in the past. specifically she received her first dose in [**2168**] and she was noted to have chills, htn, rigors, sense of doom within an hour of infusion which was relived when the infusion was stopped. she underwent a retrial of rituximab in [**2170**] with a slower rate of infusion, unfortunately she had the sensation of throat tightening and itching and the infusion was stopped. she underwent another retrial several

given her thrombocytopenia and adverse effects on other regimens pt was admitted for rituximab desensitization. she was originally admitted to the bmt floor and then transferred to the [**hospital unit name 153**] for close airway monitoring given her prior reactions to rituximab of throat itchiness, htn, rigors. she was seen by allergy who recommended a desensitization protocol of 48hrs of methylprednisolone 40mg q6hr followed by h2 blocker, benadryl with desensitization goal dose of 600mg. during and after desensitization pt did not experience any adverse reactions. she was then discharged home after the oncology team had seen her. her oncologist's office will call her for an appointment to initiate rituximab. ##. pancytopenia: pt has been pancytopenic over the past few weeks likely [**1-27**] lymphoma given her recent bm biopsy results. pt underwent bone marrow biopsy on [**12-20**] with cytogenetics for mds work-up which was still pending at time of discharge. on the bmt floor she received 2u of prbc and 1u plts. her hct remained stable albeit at a level of 22. prior to discharge pt was given another unit of prbcs. she will need to follow up with her oncologist for

[**4-30**] echo the left atrium is normal in size. the right atrium is moderately dilated. there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. the left ventricular cavity size is normal. overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (lvef>55%). the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. there is no aortic valve stenosis. mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. . [**5-1**] ct torso impression: 1. no bowel obstruction is identified. small bowel and large bowel loops appear unremarkable. 2. bilateral increased interstitial markings and septal thickening is suggestive of presence of the heart failure. the heart is also mildly enlarged. 3. small bilateral pleural effusions and dependent atelectatic changes are noted at both lung bases. infiltrate/infection cannot be ruled out. small pericardial effusion is also noted. 4. a 4-mm nodule is noted within the anterior portion of the right middle lobe. pathologically enlarged right paratracheal node measures 13 mm in the short axis. 5. diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis. 6. the aorta demonstrates severe stenosis below the renal arteries. no aneurysmal dilatation is noted. 7. small right kidney with normal sized left kidney. no hydronephrosis or stones are identified. . [**5-1**] ct head 1. no acute intracranial abnormality. 2. chronic infarcts in the right cerebellum and centrum semiovale. 3. sinus disease involving left maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. . [**5-2**] eeg impression: this is an abnormal eeg due to the presence of probable periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges (i.e., pleds) involving the right hemisphere which could indicate a subcortical abnormality involving this area. the presence of a diffusely slow background and disorganized background is consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy of toxic, anoxic, or metabolic etiology. the occasional sharp waves can be a sign of cortical irritability, but clinical correlation would need to be provided. no evidence for ongoing seizures is seen. . [**5-19**] echo/bubble study: focused study to assess for patent foramen ovale. images were obtained at rest, with cough and post-valsalva release with injection of agitated saline. no evidence for an atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale was identified. there is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function. no pericardial effusion is seen. . [**5-25**] mr spine: 1. multilevel degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine, most pronounced at the l4-5 and the l5-s1 levels respectively.2. type [**first name9 (namepattern2) **] [**last name (un) 13425**] changes of the l4 and l5 vertebral bodies respectively. 3. no evidence of epidural abscess. . [**6-10**] chest cta:1. no definite evidence of pulmonary embolus. 2. cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, and pulmonary edema, all consistent with congestive heart failure.3. right upper and right middle lobe pulmonary nodules, little change since [**2167-5-1**]. six-month followup chest ct is recommended to assess stability.4. mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive. . [**6-15**] echo bubble: saline contrast study performed to assess for intracardiac shunt. no passage of agitated saline is seen into the left heart is identified. the left ventricular cavity is normal in size. there appears to be global hypokinesis that is more pronounced/worse that the study of [**2167-5-19**]. . [**6-19**] echo: the left atrium is elongated. the right atrium is moderately dilated. the estimated right atrial pressure is [**4-16**] mmhg. left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. there is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (lvef = 30 %). systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved. no masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. the right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild globalfree wall hypokinesis. the aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-4-30**], global left ventricular systolic function is more depressed and the right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated and hypokinetic. the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher. . [**6-22**] ct of the chest without iv contrast: there is no axillary lymphadenopathy. there is pretracheal lymphadenopathy measuring up to 1.5 cm. this is unchanged. there are small bilateral effusions. these are stable. again noted is an ovoid nodule in the apex of the right lung measuring 1.2 x 0.5 cm. this is stable in appearance. there are tiny nodules in the right lung. these are again stable. there is diffuse septal thickening which is unchanged. in the presence of cardiomegaly this is consistent with chf. ct of the abdomen without iv contrast: the liver is without focal lesions. the gallbladder has been removed. spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands are unremarkable. the right kidney is atrophic. the left kidney has some bulging of the contour at mid pole measuring about 1.6 cm. this is difficult to evaluate on the prior study as there is significant artifact from the patient's body touching the gantry but is likely present. there is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. small and large bowel are normal. ct of the pelvis without iv contrast: the uterus is normal in size and contains some calcified fibroids. there is diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. there is no adjacent inflammatory fat stranding. there is no free fluid in the pelvis. no pelvic adenopathy is noted. on bone windows, there are degenerative changes involving the lumbar spine. impression: 1. no findings to explain the patient's symptoms. the examination is essentially unchanged in comparison to prior studies. 2. interstitial prominence and small bilateral pleural effusions with cardiomegaly are consistent with chf. again this is stable. 3. mediastinal adenopathy unchanged. . [**6-23**] ruq us:1. no focal fluid collections. 2. atrophic right kidney consistent with chronic renal failure. . [**2167-6-30**] 4:18p other blood chemistry: hbsag: negative hbs-ab: negative hbc-ab: negative [**2167-4-29**] 05:41pm report comment: source: line-hemodialysis hepatitis hepatitis b surface antigen negative hepatitis b surface antibody positive hepatitis b virus core antibody negative hepatitis c serology hepatitis c virus antibody positive brief hospital course: discharge summary (as of [**2167-5-27**]) assessment and plan: this is a 53 year old woman with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, copd, pulmonary hypertension, s/p l aka who is oxygen dependent on nasal canula 4 liters at home, and polysubstance abuse who presented to [**hospital3 35813**] center in [**state 792**]with altered mental status, hypoxia, and agitation. she was intubated for airway protection and transferred to [**hospital1 18**]. course complicated by anuric renal failure requiring dialysis. . 1)mental status change: most likely multifactorial, as patient with previous polysubstance abuse. chronic small vessel disease noted on head ct. eeg negative for seizure activity. per family, patient lives alone and able to care for herself and perform activities of daily living. on admission, toxicology screen revealed opiates and tricyclics, and by medical notes on transfer, patient had been using more sedating medications than normal. neurology evaluated patient and vitamin b12 and folate levels were normal. she received thiamine. tsh level was elevated to 8 and her t4 was only very slightly below normal. thus, thyroid function was not attributed to altered mental status. an eeg revealed encephalopathy, but no seizures. ct head revealed chronic small vessel disease. lp and mri were deferred. -upon extubation, patient slowly became more alert, first with purposeful eye tracking and then by following simple commands. she received haldol and ativan, which sedated her profoundly for several days. then, after extubation, she began to have conversations but with frequent outbursts with cursing at times, poor attention and short term memory. she became febrile on [**2167-5-7**], which was concerning for a line infection, and was treated initially with vanco/zosyn changed to vanco/meropenem plan for 3 day course complete [**2167-5-9**]. c. diff negative x3. her head ct was unchanged. on [**5-13**], patient had her picc line and tunneled hd line placed and developed fevers within 12 hours. only one blood culture from [**5-14**] revealed one bottle of staph coagulase negative organisms. treated with ten day course of vancomycin (per hd protocol) through [**5-23**]. -lexapro was restarted on [**2167-5-12**], but held on [**5-22**]. psychiatry continued to follow patient and for continued outbursts recommended haldol 0.5mg po/iv three times daily. as above, concern that heavy sedatives with ativan and haldol cause profound sedation. she required soft wrist restraints for prevention of line removal. pt was transferred to the micu on [**6-2**] for respiratory compromise (see below). -upon arriving at the floor on [**6-5**] the patient was aox3, but with residual confusion, impulse control issues, and aggitation. her course was complicated by recurrent episodes of aggitation and anxiety which were hard to control. she perseverated on her medications, her course, and her dietary restrictions. psych was consulted and attempted to help control these outbursts without using benzodiazepems. she often complained of dyspnea, but requested ativan as treatment. she was transferred to the micu for low o2 saturation, where she was diuresed for congestive heart failure/volume overload. she was transferred back to the floor on [**6-15**], where she continued to be anxious and take off her o2 mask. psych recommended continuing standing haldol as well as 100mg neurontin qhs. benzodiazepines were avoided. this combination had a calming effect and the patient was significantly less agitated without being over-sedated, thought to be back to her baseline mental status. remained at baseline mental status for the rest of the hospitalization . 2) respiratory compromise: at outside hospital, patient was hypoxic to high 80's on 3l. at home, she requires 4l nasal canula. patient has history of copd, chf, and pulmonary hypertension per outside notes. intubated on transfer and thought that congestive heart failure contributed to hypoxemic event. no clear pneumonia. patient was aggressively diuresed via hemodialysis. she was extubated on [**5-7**]. hypoxia seems out of proportion to edema demonstrated on imaging. tte was negative for patent foramen ovale. . on [**2167-6-1**], the patient triggered for hypoxia 68% on 6 liters (the patient formerly had been 90-92% on 6 liters. on recheck, the o2 sat was 88% and then 90-91% on 6 liters without intervention. the patient was scheduled to have hd as scheduled on [**2167-6-2**]. . at hd, the hd catheter was noted to be nonfunctioning. tpa was tried without success. then, the patient was found to be hypoxic to 75% at hd with abg 7.53/26/44 0on a 40% venti mask. on a nrb, the patient's saturations improved to 97% and a repeat gas was 7/53/27/58. . the patient denied any chest pain and says the shortness of breath was not acute in onset but had been developing over the past few days. however, her sbp was noted to be 188-216 during hd and the patient was given her am bp meds as a result. cxr indicated volume overload and pt. was thought to have had acute pulmonary edema [**1-9**] hypertension and inability to dialyze. pt was transferred to micu and had temporary femoral hd line initially placed, then tunneled hd line placed by ir [**6-3**]. she had 7l removed during micu course with improvement of oxygenation and was sent back to floor [**6-5**]. . while on the floor she was maintained on 6l of nc. she did occasionally complain of dyspnea and anxiety, however it was hard to differentiate this from her psychiatric issues, as she was often breathing at a normal rate and sat'ing in the mid 90s while complaining. she generally maintained saturations from 88-95%. she did have at least two desat's into the low 80s at night, but responded within minutes to reassurance and haldol without changing any pulmonary medications or oxygen. on [**6-9**] she had an episode of somlenence and increased confusion after her haldol had been increased to 2mg/dose and her nc o2 dropped to 4l. she was somlenent but arousable, and still oriented to self she recovered mental status quickly after a 50% venti mask was placed, and was then seen by the micu staff. she was transferred again to the micu at that point, and again was diuresed aggressively with good result. repeat tte again showed no patent foramen ovale/shunt. cta was negative for pe. . she was transferred back to the floor on [**6-15**], where she continued to required 6-8 l o2 and occasionally desat'd in setting of anxiety. an echo [**6-19**] showed evidence of worsening chf (ef 30% now, was >55% in [**month (only) **]), which would explain continued increased oxygen requirement and sob, with evidence of pulmonary edema on cxr. in conjunction with the renal team, the patient required almost daily hd or ultrafiltration to draw off fluid. attempts were made with medications to balance the need for afterload reduction with supporting a blood pressure which could tolerate volume loss through dialysis. this primarily involved decreasing the patient's betablocker and verapamil dose significantly, while maintaining isosorbide nitrate. the patient was witnessed several times eating high salty foods, and being non-compliant with the fluid restriction which complicated attempts to manage her volume status. with aggressive hd, as well as improved management of her anxiety and aggitation (above) the patient gradually was weaned down to her baseline requirement of 4l o2 on nasal cannula. . 3) anuric renal failure: atn likely from tca/opiate overdose. outside hospital records revealed creatinine of 4.0 in [**month (only) 958**] [**2166**]. on admission, anuric. she was hyperkalemic, so initially received kayxelate, calcium gluconate, insulin, and bicarbonated. no ecg changes. renal ultrasound negative for obstruction. received aggressive hemodialysis sessions. there was concern that tunneled dialysis line infected, but as she was not rigoring and did not ever develop fever or hypotension except when on dialysis, believed that filter on hemodialysis machine may have caused adverse reaction. asaghi filter used on [**5-22**] with good effect. . management of the patient's volume status was complicated by dietary noncompliance and aggitation. after requiring 2 micu transfers from the floor due to decreased oxygen saturation from pulmonary edema, we were finally able to dialyze her sufficiently to bring her back to baseline oxygen requirement. we monitored her intake carefully and impressed upon her the importance of dietary compliance. adding neurontin to her anxiety regimen helped calm her and she became more compliant with our management strategy and was less likely to take off her oxygen support. renal recommends performing a 24 hour urine collection after one month to re-evaluate her renal status. . 4) cardiovascular: --ischemia: history of coronary artery disease. as outpatient, on aspirin but no beta blocker or ace-inhibitor. ecg without ischemic changes and initial cardiac enzymes negative. continued aspirin and added beta blocker. --pump: evidence of pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure on admission. as anuric, removed excess fluid with hemodialysis. --rhythm: remained in sinus rhythm. started on beta blockade. --hypertension: severely elevated blood pressures. started amlodipine, metoprolol, and isorbide. goal blood pressure <170, but due to longstanding hypertension, developed worsened mental status when blood pressures less than 140. most likely due to hypoperfusion. in setting of hypotensive episodes during dialysis, held antihypertensives on mornings of dialysis. over the course of hospitalization, we adjusted her bp medications according to what was tolerated during dialysis. on discharge, she is taking isosorbide mononitrate 30mg sr and toprol xl 100mg q day. . 5) gi: on admission, apparent ugi bleeding. coffee grounds in ngt but this was in setting of supratherapeutic inr. subsequently resolved status post reversal of inr. treated with iv (and then po) protonix. her serial hematocrits remained stable. abdominal ct on [**5-1**] unremarkable. diverticulosis was noted on subsequent abdominal ct (as above). . 6) infectious disease: on admission, received levofloxacin, but then broadened to zosyn and vancomycin for uti. completed seven day course on [**5-5**]. shortly after discontinuation of antibiotics, was transiently febrile, so started meropenem and vancomycin on [**5-7**] for 3 day course. picc line was placed and tunneled hd line placed on [**5-13**]. febrile shortly after line placed (1/4 bottles with staph coagulase negative), so started ten day course of vancomycin that was completed on [**5-23**]. new picc placed [**6-3**] for antibiotics and question of infection. on [**6-17**] id was consulted for rising leukocytosis. bacillus species grew from [**6-19**] picc blood cx, pt was started on cefepime for bacteremia on [**6-20**] (initial culture result said gnr) and picc was d/c'd. was discovered on [**6-23**] that bacillus likely was a contaminant. pt has been afebrile, but given persistently high wbc, there was

secondary to cns lymphoma. dilantin was held since bradycadic event. pt was kept on keppra since then. pt did not seize since having been retransferred to the oncology floor. pt was discharged on keppra. . 5. hypercalcemia - pt developed hypercalcemia prior to the bradycardic event. endocrine was consulted. etiology unclear but possibly due to primary hyperthyroidism since pth was elevated. pt received calcitonin during her hospital stay as well as lasix but ca was still 12.2 on [**9-23**] (after correction for albumin of 3.0). pt remained asymptomatic and was discharged with a stable, but slightly elevated calcium. an ionized calcium was 1.47. vit d25oh was within the normal range. it is recommended that her pcp follows up on the hypercalcemia. it is suggested to get a sestamibi scan to evaluate for parathyroid adenoma/hyperplasia, as well as a dexa scan since pt is on longstanding steroids. . 6. diastolic dysfunction - pt is known to have diastolic dysfunction in the past. cardiology was consulted during her hospital stay. b/o her bradycardic episode, bb and ccb were held since then. after stabilization in the unit and retransfer to the floor, she was started on hctz 25 qd on [**9-21**] and on captopril 6.25 tid on [**9-21**]. however, hctz was d/c'ed on [**9-23**] due to hypercalcemia. . pt was discharged on lisinopril 5 mg qd and captopril was d/c'ed, as recommended by cardiology. it is recommended that her pcp is going to follow up and titrate up on the lisinopril dose if bp and renal functions allows. . 7. hypothyroidism - continue synthroid, tfts were stable. . 8. agitation - stable mostly during her stay. haldol has occasionally been used to calm her down but it was tried to avoid haldol. pt required 1:1 sitter on most nights to prevent patient from pulling out lines. pt was without sitter over 24h prior discharge. . 9. anemia - baseline hct 28-32. iron studies c/w acd, given high ferritin, low tibc. normal folate, b12. monitored hct daily. follow up is recommended as an outpatient. . 10. f/e/n - cardiac/dm diet as tolerated, lytes were repleted as needed. . 11. ppx -

dyspnea. history of present illness: the patient is a 76-year-old woman who was recently discharged from the [**hospital1 346**], where she was evaluated for multiple medical problems listed separately in the past medical history, who was transferred from [**location (un) 2716**] point because of increasing dyspnea, shortness of breath, and cough for one day. the patient has chronic fevers. she denied a battery of constitutional symptoms including headache, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria. past medical history: 1. breast cancer metastatic to [**location (un) 500**] and spleen. 2. fever of unknown origin likely due to malignancy or adrenal insufficiency. 3. left lower lobe collapse. 4. congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction and preserved ejection fraction. 5. atrial fibrillation. 6. adrenal insufficiency status post bilateral adrenalectomy. 7. melanoma status post excisional biopsy. 8. meningioma status post resection. 9. thyroid nodules of unclear origin. 10. inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release previously. 11. external hemorrhoids. allergies: opiates of unclear reaction as well as to tape, where she develops a rash. medications on presentation: 1. mirtazapine 50 mg in the evening. 2. tranxene 7.5 mg daily. 3. lorazepam 0.25 mg daily. 4. colace 100 mg twice daily. 5. fludrocortisone 0.1 mg daily. 6. hydrocortisone 30 mg in the morning and 20 mg in the evening. 7. pantoprazole 40 mg daily. 8. arimidex 4 mg daily. 9. metoprolol 62.5 mg daily. physical examination on presentation: vital signs: temperature 98.4, heart rate 101 and irregular, blood pressure of 164/67, and oxygen saturation is 89% on room air, and 98% on 4 liters nasal cannula. general: this is a chronically ill appearing elderly-pale woman, who did not cooperate with the entire examination. heent: normocephalic. there is a well-healed scar from her meningeal resection, she has anicteric sclerae and pale conjunctivae. pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus. the throat was clear. neck: supple, thyroid not palpable, the jugular veins are flat. there is no carotid bruit. nodes: there is no cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal adenopathy. lungs: she had poor effort, decreased excursion, and decreased breath sounds at the based. she had slight wheezing and crackles diffusely. heart: irregular, tachycardic, normal s1, s2, no extra sounds. abdomen: she had normal bowel sounds, soft, nontender, and nondistended. spleen tip was palpable. the liver was not palpable. extremities: the patient had +2 lower extremity edema to her mid calf. vascular: the radial, carotid, and dorsalis pedis pulses were +2 bilaterally. laboratory evaluation on presentation: white blood cell count 47.4, hematocrit 26.0, platelets 209. chemistry panel was normal. electrocardiogram revealed multifocal atrial tachycardia at 95 beats per minute, there was no interval change from a previous electrocardiograms. hospital course: 1. cardiac: over the course of the patient's long hospital stay, her dose of metoprolol was sequentially increased from 62.5 mg twice daily to ultimately 75 mg every eight hours for rate control. in consultation with the cardiology service, the patient was also given an ace inhibitor. she required periodic diuresis with furosemide, approximately every four days she received furosemide for volume overload. her heart rate and blood pressure were well controlled on this regimen. patient underwent repeat surface echocardiography which revealed increased pulmonary hypertension, unchanged ejection fraction. 2. endocrine: the patient's requirement for hydrocortisone replacement fluctuated during the course of the hospital stay in consultation with the endocrine service, an attempt was made to lower her hydrocortisone replacement, however, her white blood cell count climbed to over 70 when decreasing the dose of hydrocortisone to 25 mg every 12 hours. she ultimately required several stress doses up to 100 mg every eight hours. her fingersticks were always within the normal range despite several conventional serum glucose values below 40, this was attributed to pseudohypoglycemia caused by high white blood cell count. the patient underwent ultrasonography of the thyroid gland, which revealed nodules unchanged from previous evaluation. given the multiple comorbidities of this patient, the endocrine service did not recommend further evaluation at this time. 3. psychiatric: the patient had several episodes of confusion, paranoid delusions, and visual hallucinations. in consultation with the psychiatric service, she was given a trial of risperidone, however, the patient was overly sedated on this medication, and was eventually withdrawn. the patient underwent further computer tomography of the head revealing no new mass lesions during two or three episodes of unresponsiveness. 4. hematology: as reviewed in previous summary, the patient is now transfusion dependent. he received a transfusion of [**12-12**] pack units approximately every 3-4 days while in the hospital to maintain a hematocrit of approximately 38%. she also required periodic diuresis with blood transfusions, no fevers or adverse reactions occurred during transfusion. 5. oncology: as reviewed in previous summaries, the patient underwent [**month/day (2) 500**] marrow biopsy on her last admission. her cytogenetic evaluation revealed possible early myelodysplastic syndrome or aml given that there were two cells bearing the lesion that .................... chromosome. the oncology service was consulted, and they deemed that the patient does not have either myelodysplastic syndrome or aml. the patient underwent splenic biopsy in the interventional radiology suite twice. the first time the pathology specimen revealed collection of megakaryocytes, though was not diagnostic. the second time, a large amount of necrotic debris, macrophages was recovered as well as neutrophils. this was deemed to be consistent with infection. 6. infectious disease: patient's fevers over the first half of her hospital course abated, however, she did have persistent white blood cell elevation attributed to malignancy and adrenal insufficiency. her large left pleural effusion as well as her cerebrospinal fluids were sampled, neither which shown to have an infection. however, on [**2120-12-17**], the patient became hypotensive. urinalysis revealed enterococcal urinary tract infection. she was transferred to the intensive care unit for sepsis. she was placed on vancomycin intravenously. after two days, her blood pressure stabilized, and she was returned to the general medical floor. the remainder of this hospital summary will be dictated separately.

hydroxy-pnd brief hospital course: on [**7-19**], pt was taken to or by ortho spine for a thoracotomy with t12 vertebrectomy with t11-l1 fusion with plans to take her back on [**7-22**] for posterior approach. during the operation, pt had left lung collapse requiring a chest tube. at this point, she was started on levo/flagyl. during her stay, pt was noted to have occasional episodes of tachypnea, tachycardic to the 110s and hypertensive to the 190s. she responded well to hydralazine and morphine. lenis were done to rule out dvt and were negative. on day of transfer to icu, pt was found to have a hr in the 120s, rr in the 40s, satting 85% on 50% face mask --> 94% on nrb. (during her stay, she had been 91% on ra --> 99% on 50% face mask.) she was given lasix 20mg iv x 1 and improved somewhat symptomatically. two houws later, she again was found in resp distress and was given 20mg more of lasix. she had put out 1.3l in response to the two boluses of lasix and her saturations had improved to 97% on nrb with a decrease in her resp rate. she was then transferred to the icu for closer monitoring of her resp distress. . initially in icu, pt appeared more comfortable, satting 97-99% on nrb with rr in the mid 20s. she was given 1"" of nitropaste and 1mg of morphine to help with agitation. thirty minutes after her arrival to icu, she had another episode of respiratory distress. however, now, pt was noted to have inspiratory stridor asociated with rr to the 40s, diaphoresis and tachycardia. also, of note, the submental area of her neck appeared to be swollen but unclear what her baseline is. she was emergently intubated using fiberoptic bronchoscopy given her difficult airway. on bronchoscopy, she was noted to have a very small airway with diffuse swelling and copious secretions. she was intubated successfully and her heart rate improved to the 80s. her bp also dropped into the 50s so she was started on neosynephrine. . the remainder of her hospital course was complicated by the following issues: . 1) resp distress: in consideration of stridor which precipitated previous respiratory failure, it is possible that pt had laryngeal edema from prior intubation (during first surgery). then she also had either pneumonia or diastolic heart failure (or both) that caused some resp distress. her resp distress may have then exacerbated her pre-existing edema. in addition, the increased negative pressure from her resp distress through a narrowed airway may have caused some pulm edema. patient was intubated for resp. distress and found to have laryngeal edema during intubation. neck ct [**7-23**] showed some edema of laryngeal soft tissues around ett. no new medications were on board; however it was considered that this may have been angioedema from acei. her ace-i was thus discontinued. pt was extubated successfully on [**7-26**]. sputum from [**7-22**] grew out mrsa, now s/p 10 day course of vancomycin. cxr during episode of desaturation on [**8-7**] reveals worsening pulmonary edema. ace inhibitor was held due to questionable adverse reaction in context of respiratory difficulty. patient was diuresed to maintain negative fluid balance and urine output was adequate. she did not have further episodes of desats and remained stable on room air. patient produced adequate secretions with deep suctioning and sputum gram stain was negative and preliminary culture had no growth. she was taken off contact precautions since she was not actively infected with mrsa. she received muciprocin x 5 days [**hospital1 **] for mrsa positive nasal swab. . 2) t12 compression fracture with cord compression: patient was status post anterior and posterior decompression surgeries, performed by dr [**last name (stitle) 363**]. the chest tube from prior surgery was removed and a drain was placed. steroids were discontinued on [**7-27**]. drain was removed [**7-28**]. patient continued to remain paralyzed in her bilat les. cultures taken of wound during or proceedings negative for organisms. pain control with iv morphine, tylenol was adequate. . 3) hypertension: necessary to control pain in order to control bp. bp stabilized, back on bb, holding acei. . 4) diastolic heart failure: on recent echo ([**7-19**]), ef hyperdynamic with evidence of diastolic heart failure. beta blocker was resumed once bp was stable. patient has had slightly elevated cardiac enzymes likely from chronic left ventricular strain in context of chf. decision was made not to heparinize since ekg did not reveal st changes lowering concern for infarct. patient had a repeat echo on [**8-9**] to evaluate for worsening chf given pulmonary edema and revealed ef 55% with similar findings to prior study. . 5) anemia: baseline hct in low 30's ([**2102**] is last documented), now in mid 20's but stable; she was transfused 1 unit prbcs on [**8-7**] due to low hct and it remained around 27. patient had hemolysis workup with haptoglobin, ldh, and t bili which were all within normal limits. she was guiaic negative. . 6) schizophrenia- haldol im q month, remeron, zyprexa, and trazodone 50 mg qhs. patient had episodes of sun-downing as she was disoriented in the evenings to self and time. it was not clear whether this was her baseline mental status. lfts were checked to evaluate delirium and showed mild elevation in alt. patient's lipitor dose was decreased by half. . 7) diabetes mellitus: very low insulin need; continue riss . 8) hoarseness: patient with new hoarseness s/p extubation, now improving. per ent consult, continue ppi and she will need to be scheduled for outpatient follow-up. . 10) fen: patient failed s&s on [**8-1**] and subsequently removed her own ngt. she was at that time without nutrition source. gi placed peg on [**8-4**] and tolerated tube feeds well with no evidence of aspiration on deep suctioning. patient was started on calcitonin for regulation of pth's activity on bone resorption. levels of pth and vitamin oh-d were pending on discharge and will be followed up by pcp. . 11) healthcare proxy: patient is not competent with baseline dementia and psychiatric condition. healthcare proxy and legal guardian is [**name (ni) **] [**name (ni) 68736**], ([**telephone/fax (1) 98705**] at advoguard, inc. pcp [**last name (namepattern4) **].

[**last name (stitle) **] of gastroenterology was involved in her care. also in the medical intensive care unit, cardiology evaluated the patient as moderate risks for perioperative and postoperative complications and made recommendations for intraoperative management if hemicolectomy was part of her potential management. the patient was started on heparin and transferred out of the medical intensive care unit. on the medical floor, the patient's heparin was titrated to achieve a goal partial thromboplastin time between 60 and 80. she did not experience any more gross blood per rectum. her stools with two exceptions were guaiac negative. her hematocrit stabilized around 30.0. during the rest of her stay, she experienced one episode of respiratory distress with a bump in her troponin level of 7.6 which was believed to be due to an acute exacerbation of her congestive heart failure. pulmonary evaluated the patient on [**2118-4-11**], and reported moderately severe obstructive airways disease likely due to emphysematous and moderately severe restrictive lung dysfunction, low tlc likely due to kyphosis, obesity and right effusion. her pulmonary function tests showed the tlc 53% of predictive, fev1 0.74 which was 34% of predicted, fvc 1.31, fev1/fvc ratio 74% of predicted. it is believed that there would be a significant risk of pulmonary problems. [**name (ni) 6**] echocardiogram was obtained on [**2118-4-15**]. the left atrium was moderately dilated, overall left ventricular systolic function was estimated near normal, left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%, right ventricular cavity was moderately dilated. it was believed the patient risk of having colectomy outweighed risk of leaving the patient with less anticoagulation given her poor cardiopulmonary status. it was believed that a repeat colonoscopy with biopsy with an excellent preparation would help us better assess the source of her bleeding and would aid in the nonoperative management of future gastrointestinal bleeds. the patient refused the procedure. the patient's clinical picture continued to improve with aggressive diuresis. she was transitioned from heparin to warfarin. condition on discharge: her condition on discharge was improved. discharge diagnoses: 1. gastrointestinal bleed. 2. congestive heart failure. 3. status post aortic valve replacement. 4. coronary artery disease. 5. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 6. atrial fibrillation. 7. diabetes mellitus type 2. 8. hypercholesterolemia. medications on discharge: 1. albuterol inhaler two puffs four times a day. 2. captopril 6.25 mg p.o. three times a day. 3. digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. once daily. 4. furosemide 120 mg p.o. three times a day. 5. gabapentin 100 mg p.o. q.h.s. 6. insulin. 7. ipratropium inhaler two puffs four times a day. 8. metolazone 5 mg p.o. twice a day. 9. metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. twice a day. 10. pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. once daily. 11. simvastatin 10 mg p.o. once daily. 12. spironolactone 25 mg p.o. once daily. 13. warfarin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. 14. sulfadem 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. discharge status: she will return to her rehabilitation facility.

recent admission for bronchitis who presented from rehab c/o 4-day h/o melena, lightheadedness, and abdominal pain. she underwent egd and colonoscopy on [**11-7**] (reports above) when a l colon mass was found and biopsies taken. surgical course: the general surgery team was consulted on [**11-8**] in regards to the mass found in the left colon on colonoscopy. it was determined that the patient would require surgical resection of the left colon and she was booked for surgery on [**2124-11-14**]. on the night prior to surgery she underwent a bowel prep. during the procedure the left colon was successfully resected in an open procedure. the mass was located in the splenic flexure. her tissue in this region was noted to be quite friable and there was injury to spleen during mibilization of the flexure. it was decided to perform a splenectomy to avoid possible bleeding complications. a central line and [**initials (namepattern4) **] [**last name (namepattern4) 3389**] local anesthesia pump were placed intraoperatively. post-operatively she was taken to the pacu and remained there overnight for increased monitoring giving the amount of intraoperative blood loss and her age/comorbidities. secondary to altered mental status (sedation and then agitation) as well as decreased respiratory drive and continued o2 requirement, she was transferred from the pacu to the trauma surgical icu. the patient experienced delerium on transfer to the icu which she gradually recovered from over the following days, returning to her baseline mental status. postoperative cxr's were suggestive of a r lung wedge infarct, which seemed unlikely. therefore a ct of the chest was performed to confirm this diagnosis(without contrast given reports of prior adverse reaction), which did not show any pulmonary infarct, but did show a rll pneumonia. zosyn was started empirically for nosocomial pneumonia. on [**11-16**] the patient was transferred to the surgical floor, however on [**11-18**] she went into rapid a-fib with some hemodynamic instability (mild hypotension). diltiazem and beta-blockade was started. the patient expericenced a 4 second pause in cardiac rhythm and relative hypotension and so was transferred back to the icu for rate control by diltiazem drip and beta blockade. over the following days her cardiac rate improved. she was transitioned to po diltiazem and beta-blockers were titrated to obtain adequate rate control. she remained in a-fib, and given the patient's desire to avoid anticoagulation, as well as her fall risk, it was decided by the surgical and cardiology teams not to have the patient on anti-coagulation except aspirin. of note, the patient does have a history of paroxysmal af, for which she had refused anticoagulation previously. this issue may be addressed by her pcp and cardiologist after discharge. the patient regained bowel function on [**11-20**] and was able to ambulate with assistance. she was advanced to a soft regular diet, which she tolerated well, however required significant encouragment to increase intake. on [**11-23**] it was noted that the patient's acute medical and surgical issues had been adequate dealt with and that her primary goals of care were that of physical rehabilitation. she was therefore discharged to [**hospital3 2558**] for acute rehabilitation on the afternoon of [**11-23**]. discharge instructions and follow up as listed above. splenectomy: performed during procedure of [**11-14**]. patient was administered spenectomy vaccines (pneumococcus, h-flu, and meningicoccus) prior to discharge. . cardiology was consulted for rapid/paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. . gi was consulted on [**11-4**] for gi bleed and recommended protonix, transfusion with goal hct >30 and egd and colonoscopy which were performed [**11-7**]. . pre-operative course issues: melena: the patient presented with 4-day h/o melena with diarrhea, lightheadiness and abdominal pain. this was c/w with upper gi bleeding even though ng lavage was negatvie in. her hct decreased to 25 and she received 2 units of prbc. her hct was stable throughout the hospital stay. she was not tachycardic or hypotensive. she had a edg done wich showed gastritis and a submucosal lesion in the mid-esophagus. colonoscopy revealed two polyps and a malignant appearing mass at 45 cm. there was no active bleeding identified. the pathology report came back as ademoma and one specimen . surgery was consulted who recommeneded an operation to remove the mass. she had a ct chest for staging and a pre-op evaluation by cardiology. . lightheadedness: the patients's lightheadiness started at the same time she noticed melena and diarrhea. this was most likley related to her anemia. her lightheadedness was unchanged throughout the pre-operative portion of her hospital stay. she had no orthostatics. . abdominal pain: the patient's abdominal pain was in the epigastric area. there was suspicion for pancreatitis given slightly elevated amylase and lipase, however there was no clinical or radiographic evidence. . chest pain: her chest pain has been chronic and did not appear to be cardiac in etiology. she had no doe, no radiation to arm or jaw. her cardiac enzyme x 1 was negative. stress test in [**2120**] was normal. her ekg was unchanged. she was on telemtry with no concerning changes. . cough: she has a recent hospitalization end of octover [**2123**] for bronchitis. her cough was improving. she was on albuterol nebs prn and anti-tussant prn. . chronic renal insufficiency: the patient's creatinine was 1.5 on admission, which was baseline. her cr was stable at 1.4-1.5 throughout the hospital stay. . diabetes mellitus type 2: her blood sugars were in the range of 80-200. she had mild hypoglycemic symptoms after being npo for her procedure. she received juice and d5w. she was stable throughout her hospital stay. she was on an insulin sliding scale.

(1) mrsa bacteremia - initial source for infection was likely the tunneled hd catheter. the catheter was removed, and a temporary line was placed over a wire at the same site initially. however, as her blood cultures failed to clear, the temporar hd line was removed [**2113-2-7**], and a new l-sided temporary hd line was placed. nonetheless, her blood cultures remained positive, despite apparently therapeutic levels of vancomycin, with worsening leukocytosis, and gentamycin was added for synnergy. tte and tee did not reveal evidence of endocarditis, though chest ct suggested probable mrsa pneumonia. diagnostic thoracentesis was performed [**2-10**] and negative for infection. us of the r sided arm and neck veins was negative for clot as a source of infection. blood cultures remained positive until [**2-12**]. on [**2-15**] she was started on daptomycin iv 6 mg/kg q 48 hours and on [**2-16**] the temporary dialysis catheter was changed over a wire and the tip cultured with no growth. ct of the entire spine with contrast and of the torso was also performed with the following results: ct results [**2-16**]: * chest and abdomen * 1. no discrete abscesses or abnormal fluid collections are seen aside from right-sided pleural effusion and associated atelectasis. 2. markedly distended gallbladder, with gallstones. this can be seen in the setting of prolonged fasting, although if there are symptoms referrable to this region, right upper quadrant ultrasound could be performed. 3. marked coronary artery calcifications. 4. equivocal soft tissue filling defect adjacent to the left ij central venous catheter, which could represent adherent thrombus at the tip. note that ct is neither sensitive nor specific for detection of adherent thrombus. 5. two or three areas of focal consolidation in subpleural locations within the right upper lobe as described above. * spine * ct of the cervical spine: evaluation of the soft tissue windows demonstrates no evidence of abnormal fluid collection or bony destruction. there is no cervical lymphadenopathy present. there is a 7 mm low density right thyroid nodul, which can be evaluated by ultrasound if clinically indicated. also, right-sided pleural effusion is seen, indeterminately evaluated on this examination. evaluation of the coronally and sagittally reformatted images demonstrates appropriate alignment of the cervical spine, without significant abnormal soft tissue swelling. degenerative narrowing of the disc spaces at c6-7, c7-t1, are seen without significant facet changes at these levels. note is made of marked vascular calcifications involving the cavernous internal carotid arteries as well as a left-sided internal jugular central venous catheter. ct of the thoracic spine: scans are marred by artifact and of limited diagnostic quality. no fracture is identified. alignment is normal. the vertebral body heights are normal, however there is marked diffuse disc space narrowing. there are a few small areas of decreased attenuation in somee of the vertebral bodies. this is of uncertain nature. no endplate cortical destruction is seen. vertebral bodies have bridging osteophytes. there is poor visualization of the intraspinal structures. there are no gross abnormalities observed in the perivertebral soft tissues. there is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion. ct lumbar spine: again seen is grade 1 anterolisthesis of l4 in relation to l5 and new grade 1 to 2 anterolisthesis of l5 on s1. the remaining vertebral bodies are well aligned. there is vacuum disc phenomenon at l5-s1. there is disc space narrowing at t12-l1, l1-l2, l2-l3, likely l3-l4, l4-l5, and l5-s1. again noted are pedicle screws and posterior rods transfixing l3 through l5. there is associated laminectomy at these vertebral levels. the neural foramina in the lower lumbar region are difficult to assess secondary to hardware artifact. no vertebral fractures or hardware loosening is appreciated. there are no destructive changes of the endplates to indicate osteomyelitis. the prevertebral soft tissues appear morphologically normal. the posterior soft tissues are obscured by artifact from the fusionhardware. the intraspinal contents are not well seen. she was unable to fit into an mri scanner for evaluation of possible osteomyelitis or epidural abscess given persistent postitive cultures and back pain. ct scan was done as above and plan for open mri as an outpatient. she remained culture negative despite daily surveillance cultures until [**2-20**]. she was switched back to vancomycin. from [**2-13**] to [**2-27**] her blood cultures (collected at each dialysis) were negative. should they have vecome positive again, plan was to pursue a white blood cell tagged scan to identify a source of infetion. due to mechanical falure of the line her dialysis catheter was changed over a wire on [**2-21**] and then a tunneled catheter was placed [**2-24**]. she has been awaiting placement with no events occurring since [**2-24**]. (2) cri/esrd - upon admission, it was hoped that the patient's renal function had recoverd to the extent that hd could be delayed for several months. however, attempts to achieve fluid balance with diuretics, including lasix and metalozone, were unsuccessful, and given worsening cr, the decision was made to proceed with hemodialysis. phoslo was titrated. she has been on t/th/saturday dialysis since admission. ultrafiltration has been pursued to remove fluid. on one occasion [**2-24**], she experienced hypotension with nausea after dialysis. the hypotension responded to 1l fluids. given this was like her presentation with nstemi, a set of cardiac enzymes was checked (troponin still trending down from previous event) and an ekg (no changes). the nausea resolved with the hypotension. likely etiology was too much fluid removal with ultrafiltration. (3) anemia - patient required several units of prbc transfusions, and was started on erythropoietin 8000u thrice weekly. this is most likely because of chronic kidney disease combined with extensive phlebotomy here (many many blood cultures and chem 10, cbc daily until [**2-21**] when they were changed to dialysis days only). (4) chf - patient noted to have mildly decompensated heart failure,likely secondary to volume overload while dialysis was on hold. she was not started on an ace or [**last name (un) **], given prior adverse reactions, but was maintained on low-dose beta-blocker. (5) back pain - no clear etiology evident on ct scan, doubt abscess or osteomyelitis. this is may be from anterolisthesis of l5 on s1 as seen in ct scan. (6) a-fib - continued b-blocker. re-starting anticoagulation with coumadin, please maintain inr between 2 and 2.5. on aspirin/plavix.

sepsis of likely urinary origin: upon presentation to [**hospital1 18**] on [**3-11**], had blood pressure drop to 70s sytolic. she was given 5l ivf in ed and transferred to micu. cxr was unrevealing. u/a showed increased leuks and wbc on urine micro. was empirically started on meropenem in micu given that patient had recently been on carbapenems for a uti in end of 1/[**2126**]. in micu her bp was intially stable and then fell and patient was started on norepinephrine, which she remained on for approximately 17 hours on [**3-12**]. given patient's severe abdominal pain, received a ct abd/pelvis in the ed which showed moderate ascites, though no other acute changes. surgery consult was called and felt that there was no acute surgical intervention indicated and followed the patient's course in the micu. we also trended patient's lactate level, which was 3.2 at presentation and trended down to 1.3 with fluid resuscitation. checked cdiff toxin, which was negative. iv team was called to assist in managment of patient's tunneled double lumen catheter and they suggested ethanol dwells between tpn infusions in order to prevent line infection. blood cultures from [**3-11**] and [**3-12**] were negative. . # abdominal pain: pain with severe abdominal pain upon presentation. we reassured after ruling out acute intra-abdominal process with ct scan and serial exams. given frequent (q1hour) iv dilaudid requirements on morning of [**3-13**], pain service consult was called; however, prior to pain service seeing patient her pain improved to point that dilaudid could be given less frequently. was felt that we had been behind on pain control after sleeping overnight, possible due to held doses of gabapentin. she was continued on methadone, dilaudid, and gabapentin. . # anemia: hct was found to be 22, pt was transfused 1 unit of prbcs. post-transfusion hct was 26.9. . medicine floor course: [**date range (1) 32116**]: patient was called out from the micu on [**2126-3-13**] after she had been normotensive for 24 hours without pressors. she had a new oxygen requirement (94% on 4l) thought [**2-20**] volume overload (8 l + for los). overnight, she was hypertensive to 188/80. in the morning she was found to be hypoxic to 81% on 4l. she was put on a non-rebreather with intermittent improvement of her oxygen sats to low 90s but would then drop to low 80s. she was also given iv lasix 20 mg x 2 and she put out 2 l in 2 hours. her blood pressure was treated with hydralazine 20 mg iv x1 and sl nitro. despite these interventions she was still hypoxic in the 80s on a non-rebreather and was transferred back to the micu for positive pressure ventilation and aggressive diuresis. . micu course: [**date range (1) 97780**]: cxr was c/w volume overload, likely from fluid resuscitation she received in the micu. she was diuresed with iv lasix and started on azithromycin for atypical pneumonia coverage. ct chest performed later revealed extensive fibrotic changes and ground-glass opacities suggestive of pneumonitis such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drug toxicity, or nsip. pneumonitis workup was initiated. esr =83, crp = 188.2, [**doctor first name **], anca, beta-glucan, and galactomannan were all negative. she was stable and was transferred to the floor for further evaluation. . medicine floor course: [**date range (1) 20494**]: pt was stable and continued to improved. active issues: . # hypoxemia/pulmonary infiltrates: oxygenation gradually improved and pt was weaned off oxygen supplement gradually. etiology of infiltrates was unclear, possibilities included [**name (ni) **] and medication-induced lung toxicity. pt received 1 course of azithromycin for possible atypical pneumonia. her flu and legionella screenings were negative. she was weaned off o2 and mantained 95%+ saturation on room air at the time of discharge. . # urosepsis: pt remained hemodynamically stable on the floor. she received meropenem for total of 7 days ([**date range (1) 28666**]). she remained without urinary complaints. pt was given hyoscyamine for bladder spasm pain. . #anemia: the patients hematocrit trended down throughout her hospitalization from around 27 to a low of 22. her baseline over the last few months has been 25-28. this was attributed to her ongoing inflammation secondary to her radiation enteritis and cystitis, although the precise etiology remains unclear, and infection and myelodysplasia should be considered as well. her manual reticulocyte count was found to be 1.7 (corrected 0.53), indicating insufficient marrow response. her ostomy output was found to be guiac negative and her c+ ct scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no evidence of active bleeding. hemolysis labs demonstrated no evidence of ongoing hemolytic process, however corrected retic count was low. this can be due to illness or medication suppression. recent iron studies were all within normal limits. pt was instructed to follow up with primary care physician about this issue, with repeat hct/reticulocyte count and further workup as needed. . # abdominal pain/fluid collections: the patient had known chronic abdominal pain related to cervical cancer and radiation complications. c. diff was been negative. we continued her home medication (methadone and oxycodone), and added dilaudid. pt was able to eat and drink, and did not have any vomiting. she was evaluated with kub for possible obstruction, which showed dilated loops of bowel. ct of abdomen demonstrated multiple fluid collections, enlarged fluid filled bladder, l hydronephrosis, and a dilated fluid filled ureteral stump. urology was consulted, and a foley was placed for decompression. when the patient was taken for ct-guided drainage of the collections, the collections had almost completely disappeared, potentially related to decompression from the foley catheter. fluid from the remaining collection was sampled and sent for culture and analysis, which demonstrated no bacteria and a creatinine of 1.8 (not consistent with urinoma). repeat ultrasound demonstrated interval resolution of the previoulsy noted hydronephrosis and stable appearance of the fluid collections compared to the most recent ct scan. . chronic issues: . # ckd: pt cr remained at her her baseline, and no new acute issues. . # short gut syndrome: we continued pt's tpn and she was also followed by the nutritionist while she was in the hospital. . # anxiety/depression: we continued pt's home meds (alprazolam, fluoxetine). . # chronic pain/fibromyalgia: we continued the pt's home meds (gabapentin, methadone). . # hypothyroidism: we continued the pt's home med (levothyroxine). . # osteoporosis: we continued the pt's home med (vitamin d, calcium). . #htn: we restarted pt's lisinopril on [**3-19**] after her blood pressure returned to its chronically high level. medications on admission: 1. alprazolam 0.25 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po qhs (once a day (at bedtime)) as needed for insomnia. 2. ergocalciferol (vitamin d2) 50,000 unit capsule sig: one (1) capsule po 5x/week (mo,tu,we,th,fr). 3. fexofenadine 60 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 4. fluoxetine 20 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po tid (3 times a day). 5. gabapentin 300 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po qid (4 times a day). 6. levothyroxine 50 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 7. pantoprazole 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one (1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po q24h (every 24 hours). 8. pilocarpine hcl 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po q4h (every 4 hours). 9. methadone 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po qid (4 times a day). 10. ertapenem 1 gram recon soln sig: one (1) gram intravenous once a day for 6 days.

swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or filamentous fungi. a negative result should be interpreted with caution. whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated fluid should be submitted. anaerobic culture (final [**2153-2-26**]): no anaerobes isolated. . imaging: ecg ([**2-8**]): sinus tachycardia at a rate of 112. diffuse non-specific st-t wave changes. no previous tracing available for comparison. . liver/gallbladder ultrasound ([**2-8**]): impression: 1. limited imaging of the liver shows increased echogenicity indicating fatty infiltration. of note, more serious forms of liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study. 2. no evidence of gallbladder wall edema or thickening; however, the gallbladder is not completely decompressed. if there is continued clinical concern for acute cholecystitis, a nuclear medicine gallbladder scan may be performed. . ct abdomen/pelvis ([**2-8**]): ct abdomen and pelvis without iv contrast: in the lungs, there are bibasilar opacification with air bronchograms on the right, likely representing aspiration. the visualized portion of the heart and great vessels appears essentially normal, although there are vascular calcifications. in the abdomen, the spleen is normal and an incidental note is made of a splenule. the kidneys are small and there is some mild, non-specific perirenal fat stranding. the liver is diffusely fatty, but there is no focal parenchymal mass identified on this noncontrast scan. allowing for the lack of iv contrast, the gallbladder, adrenals, pancreas, stomach, duodenum and small bowel appear normal. there is no free air, free fluid or abdominal lymphadenopathy. in the pelvis, the pelvic loops of bowel appear normal excepting for sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. a foley catheter is in place and the bladder appears normal. there are prostatic calcifications and the seminal vesicles appear normal. no pelvic free fluid, free air or lymphadenopathy is identified. osseous structures: no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. there is grade i anterolisthesis of l5 on s1 and associated bilateral spondylolysis. impression: 1. likely new aspiration bibasilar, worse on the right. 2. no evidence for hepatic mass or pancreatitis on this noncontrast study. 3. diffuse fatty liver. 4. spondylolisthesis with bilateral pars defects at l5. . ct head ([**2-8**]): there is no intracranial hemorrhage. an old right caudate lacunar infarct is seen. there is no shift of normally midline structures, loss of [**doctor last name 352**]-white matter differentiation, abnormality in size or contour of ventricles, or gross osseous abnormality. mastoid air cells are clear. there is mild sinonasal thickening of the ethmoid air cells. impression: no acute intracranial process. . cxr portable ([**2-8**]): impression: 1. non-standard position of ett; needs to be withdrawn. 2. og tube in standard position, although side port is at the diaphragmatic level. . cxr portable ([**2-8**]): impression: standard position of et tube and now distended stomach. . cxr portable ([**2-8**]): impression: 1. interval insertion of a right ij line with tip projecting over the right atrium; this means retraction by approximately 3 to 4 cm is recommended. 2. new right upper lobe collapse. . cxr portable ([**2-8**]): right internal jugular vascular catheter has been re-positioned, but distal tip is still slightly below the expected junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium. nasogastric tube side port remains proximal to the ge junction level and could be advanced for optimal placement. right upper lobe collapse has resolved in the interval, and there has been improvement in the degree of gastric distention. otherwise no substantial short-interval change. . cxr portable ([**2-8**]): moderate right pleural effusion has increased since earlier in the day following resolution of right upper lobe collapse. the heart size is top normal, unchanged, and there is no longer any mediastinal vascular engorgement. left lung is clear, and there is no left pleural effusion or any evidence of pneumothorax. tip of the endotracheal tube is at the thoracic inlet, and the cuff remains mildly over-inflated. nasogastric tube ends in a non-distended stomach. tip of the right internal jugular line projects over the superior cavoatrial junction. . cxr portable ([**2-9**]): tip of the et tube is in standard placement, below the thoracic inlet, approximately 5 cm above carina. nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and tip of a right jugular line in the upper right atrium. small right pleural effusion is still present. heart size mildly enlarged, and mediastinal veins are still engorged. left lung is clear. no evidence of pneumonia or lobar collapse, and no pneumothorax is present. . cxr portable ([**2-10**]): the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right-sided central venous catheter are in unchanged position. there is cardiomegaly with some prominence in the mediastinum which is stable. there is no signs for overt pulmonary edema or focal consolidation. . cxr pa/lateral ([**2-13**]): the patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal of the ng tube. the right internal jugular line tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction. the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. the right lower lobe consolidation is demonstrated, overall slightly improved since [**2153-2-10**] which might represent area of improving pneumonia/aspiration. minimal retrocardiac opacity on the left is noted most likely consistent with atelectasis. a small bilateral pleural effusion is persistent. impression: right lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia/aspiration, slightly improving. left basal atelectasis. . bilateral foot films ([**2-15**]): impressions: no bony abnormalities or soft tissue calcification suggestive of gout. small bilateral plantar calcaneal spurs. . cxr pa/lateral ([**2-16**]): right lower lobe consolidation has markedly improved with subtle heterogeneous opacities remaining in the periphery of the right lower lung. no new or progressive abnormalities are identified. cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. small pleural effusions have decreased in size. impression: resolving right lower lobe consolidation and improving small pleural effusions. . ct abdomen/pelvis ([**2-17**]): ct abdomen with contrast: previously noted consolidation within the right lower lobe has demonstrated interval improvement with only a small amount of residual patchy opacity remaining. there is a small residual right pleural effusion and trace left effusion. the liver, stomach, spleen, splenule, adrenal glands, kidneys and collecting systems are unremarkable. the pancreas appears normal in appearance without focal abnormality or ductal dilatation. intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are normal in appearance. no free fluid or free air is identified in the abdomen. there are several tiny lymph nodes in the paraaortic region. calcified and irregular atherosclerotic plaque is detected within the descending abdominal aorta and iliac branches without aneurysmal dilatation. ct pelvis with contrast: the bladder demonstrates a small amount of intraluminal air, consistent with recent foley catheterization detected on previous study. there is a small bladder outpouching in the left lateral aspect suggesting a diverticulum. the distal ureters, rectum, and seminal vesicles are normal in appearance. there is a small amount of calcification within the prostate gland, which is otherwise unremarkable. no inguinal or iliac adenopathy is identified. osseous structures: there is a synovial herniation pit of the left femoral head. no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified. there is grade i anterolisthesis of l5 on s1 and associated bilateral spondylolysis. impression: 1. interval improvement of bibasilar consolidations. 2. diffuse fatty liver. 3. spondylolisthesis with pars defects at l5. 4. irregular calcified atherosclerotic plaque within the abdominal aorta and iliac branches. 5. small right pleural effusion. 6. small outpouching of the left lateral bladder wall suggesting a diverticulum. . lenis ([**2-21**]): impression: no evidence of dvt of bilateral lower extremities. brief hospital course: # pancreatitis: the patient has a history of alcohol abuse, and presented with a 1 day history of acute onset [**7-15**] sharp pain across his epigastrium that radiated to his back and was associated with nausea and vomiting. labs on admission were significant for wbc 12.5 with 91% neutrophils, ast 405/alt 243/alk phos 173/t bili 4.4, amylase 1073/lipase 5586, lactate 4.1. liver/gallbladder ultrasound showed increased echogenicity of the liver indicating fatty infiltration, and no evidence of gallbladder wall edema or thickening, but the gallbladder was not completely decompressed. ct abdomen/pelvis showed no evidence for hepatic mass or pancreatitis on the noncontrast study. in the ed he received 7 l ns and was started on levofloxacin 500 mg iv x1, flagyl 500 mg iv x1, and clincamycin 600 mg iv x1. he had at least 6 [**last name (un) 5063**] criteria (he did not have an abg in 48 hours). he was intially sent to the micu as he had been intubated for airway protection, and started on levophed gtt for hypotension. blood cultures grew [**3-9**] e. coli, which was thought to be from translocation from the pancreatitis. he was treated with ivf and zosyn->ciprofloxacin. he was initially made npo, briefly placed on tube feeds via an njt, and then started on a regular diet. his amylase and lipase trended down, but then bumped back up on [**2-12**], likely due to his njt feeds being transitioned to oral food. his amylase/lipase plateaued, and his abdominal pain ressolved. he was continued on a regular low fat diet. he continued to spike fevers, and a repeat ct abdomen/pelvis showed that the pancreas appeared normal in appearance without focal abnormality or ductal dilatation. his amylase was 206 and his lipase was 351 on discharge. . # e. coli bacteremia: blood cultures on admission showed [**3-9**] bottles of pansenstive e. coli, which was thought to be secondary to translocation from the pancreatitis. he was treated with zosyn->ciprofloxacin 500 mg [**hospital1 **] for a 13 day course (he was stopped 1 day short of a 14 day course as ciprofloxacin may have been contributing to a drug fever, see below). surveillance blood cultures showed no growth and ngtd. . # fevers: since [**2-12**], the patient would spike fevers to 101 each evening around midnight. this was not likely due to recurrence of e. coli bacteremia as subsequent blood cultures had shown no growth. repeat ct abdomen/pelvis had shown that the pancreas appears normal in appearance without focal abnormality or ductal dilatation. esr was elevated to 130, and crp was 31.9. ddx included drug fever (cipro and colchicine were new), gout, atelectasis, aspiration pna, aspiration pneumonitis, dvt, and endocarditis (no murmur on exam). rheumatology was reconsulted and determined that there were no findings suggestive of synovitis, periarthritis, or discitis on joint exam. dermatology was consulted to evaluate the papules on his chest and determined that he has several follicularly based papules and pustules which appear to be consistent with folliculitis, and this does not appear to be a disseminated fungal infection as he is well appearing, immunocompetent, with negative blood cultures. pustule culture showed rare growth of staph coag negative and no fungus isolated. the repeat ct abdomen pelvis did show a small residual right pleural effusion and trace left effusion, but the team did not decide to tap it given it would likely be low yield. lenis were negative for dvt bilaterally. id was consulted for the persistent fever, and determined that it was most likely a drug fever, but urine eos were negative. ciprofloxacin was discontinued after a 13 day course. the team decided not to continue thiamine, folate, mvi, and feso4 upon discharge, as these new medications may be contributing to his drug fever. they can be added back on as an outpatient when his fevers ressolve. . # gout: on [**2-14**], the patient developed right great toe pain. he reported that he intermittently gets this pain in his right great toe, but denies arthritis in his ankles, knees, or elbows. he has no foot hardware in place. he has a history of alcohol abuse putting him at risk for gout. he did have an e. coli bacteremia on admission putting him as risk for a septic joint, but had subsequent negative surveillance blood cultures. his right first mtp was erythematous and swollen on exam. the joint was tapped by rheumatology, and found to have 2 cc serosanguenous turbid fluid, with intra- and extra-cellular needle shaped crystals, which were negatively birefringent consistent with monosodium urate. gram stain showed 1+ pmns but no microorganisms, and joint culture showed no growth. plain film of his bilateral feet showed no bony abnormalities or soft tissue calcification suggestive of gout and small bilateral plantar calcaneal spurs. he was started on colchicine 0.6 daily for 1 week, then every other day until rheumatology follow up. his hctz was discontinued, and he was encouraged to abstain from etoh abuse. the patient had another gout flare on the evening prior to discharge (and spiked a low grade temp to 100.5), so rheumatology was notified and will call him in a few days to see how he is doing. he will follow up with rheumatology in 4 weeks, and will likely need to start allopurinol at that time. . # alcohol abuse/withdrawal: the patient has a history of drinking approximately 4 glasses of rum and coke every night. in the micu, he was maintained on versed while intubated, and then on valium per ciwa scale. during this hospitalization, he was started on thiamine, folate, and mvi. the patient was discharged home, and will follow up with an outpatient alcohol treatment program at the va. he is interested in an inpatient etoh program, but did not want to attend the one at the va since it is unsupervised at night. the patient was not discharged on thiamine, folate, and mvi, as these new medications may have been contributing to his fevers. they can be added back on later as an outpatient. . # respiratory failure/aspiration pna: the patient was initially intubated for airway protection after receiving ativan in the ed. ct abdomen/pelvis on admission showed likely new aspiration bibasilar, worse on the right. subsequent cxrs in the micu did not show any infiltrates. on initial attempts to extubate, patient did not have a cuff-leak and was treated with decadron. patient was successfully extubated on [**2-11**] and had a speech and swallow evaluation which recommended po nectar thick liquids and soft solid consistencies. repeat evaluation indicated the patient could have a regular diet with thin liquids. repeat cxr pa/lateral on [**2-13**] showed right lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia slightly improving, and left basal atelectasis. . # thrombocytosis: his platelet count was 243 on admission and trended up to 617 on [**2-21**]. this may be a reactive thrombocytosis in response to an infection or even his iron deficiency. he may also have had a delayed reactive increase in platelets in response to the zosyn or cipro. his platelets did not decrease in response to 1 l ns. his platelets were 516 on discharge, and should continue to be followed as an outpatient. . # anemia: the patient's hct was 41.3 on admission, which initially dropped to 32.1 in the setting of fluid resuscitation. ng lavage in the micu was guaiac negative. his mcv was 103-106 which suggests macrocytosis in the setting of alcohol use. his hct plateaued at 23-27. his stool was guaiac negative. fe studies showed: fe 24, tibc 203 (transferrin sat 11.8%), ferritin 845, trf 156. vit b12 476, folate 8.2. hemolysis labs showed: ldh 175, t bili 0.8, retic 2.4%, hapto 164. he was started on thiamine, folate, and feso4, but he was not discharged on these medications as they may have been contributing to his drug fevers. these medications can be added back as an outpatient once his fevers ressolve. his hct was 23.4 on discharge. he was scheduled for an outpatient colonoscopy and egd. . # transaminitis: alt 243/ast 405 on admission, which is most likely secondary to alcohol abuse. ct abdomen/pelvis showed diffuse fatty liver. hav ab, hbsag, hbcag, hgcab, and hcv ab negative. . # arf: his cr was 2.3 on admission, and has trended down to 1.5-1.7. it is unclear what his baseline cr is, and his arf on admission was thought to be prerenal from third-spacing in the setting of acute pancreatitis. urine lytes: fena 4.27%, uosm 573. he was fluid resuscitated in the ed and micu, with improvement in cr to 1.5 on discharge. his renal function should be monitored closely, especially now that he is on colchicine. . # diarrhea: the patient developed diarrhea in the micu, and c. diff was negative x3. he was started on pancrease tid with meals as there may be a component of malabsorption with his pancreatitis, but he was not discharged on this medication. his subsequent diarrhea was thought to be a side effect of colchicine. . # hypertension: his hctz was discontinued in the setting of gout. his lisinopril was increased to 30 mg daily. he was started on toprol xl 100 mg daily. . # glaucoma: he was continued on cosopt and lumigan eye drops. medications on admission: medications on admission: lisinopril-hctz 20mg-12.5mg daily cosopt 2% - 0.5% eye gtts lumigan 0.03% eye gtts . allergies/adverse reactions: codeine (""feels loopy"") discharge medications: 1.

1. if you develop increased abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, inability to tolerate food or fluids, fever >101.5, increased cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or any other symptoms that concern you, call your primary care physician or return to the ed. 2. take all medications as prescribed. 3. attend all follow up appointments. 4. your lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide combination pill was discontinued during this hospitalization, as hydrochlorothiazide can contribute to gout. now you should take lisinopril 30 mg daily. 5. you were started on toprol xl 100 mg daily for your blood pressure. 6. you were started on colchicine 0.6 mg daily to complete a 1 week course for gout ([**date range (1) 77757**]). after that you should take colchicine 0.6 mg every other day until you follow up with rheumatology on [**3-19**]. 7. you should stop drinking alcohol, as this is contributing to your pancreatitis, gout, and other medical problems. followup instructions: you have a follow

systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid-lv segments and akinesis of the distal segments and apex. the basal lv segments contract normally (lvef = 30-35%). no masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. the diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. the mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. there is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. there is no pericardial effusion. impression: no outflow tract obstruction. moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. no lv thrombus seen. in absence of obstructive coronary artery disease, these findings are consistent with takotsubo-type cardiomyopathy. if clinically indicated, recommend a repeat study in [**2-23**] weeks to reassess wall motion abnormalities. brief hospital course: this is a 70 year old female with hx of htn who was trasferred from [**hospital3 4107**] for ?nstemi and cardiac cath, which showed clean coronaries and likely takutsobo's. # takutsobo's cardiomyopathy: on admission, the patient had a troponin elevation and lateral ecg changes concerning for acs. however her cardiac cath showed clean coronary arteries and an lv gram consistent with takutsobo's cmp. echo showed apical akinesis also consistent with the diagnosis. the patient's recent stress and blood donation in preparation of her upcoming surgery likely precipitated the illness. as the patient has an allergy to ace-i, this was not initiated. she had at first some low blood pressures so beta blocker were also held initially. she was able to be started on low dose carvedilol and valsartan, without any documented adverse reaction. she was monitored overnight for cardiogenic shock and remained stable in the ccu. she was transferred to the cardiology floor. she was also initiated on warfarin for the risk of thrombus with apical akinesis. she will follow up with a new outpatient cardiologist, dr. [**last name (stitle) 10543**], for repeat echo in [**12-23**] weeks, as this etiology is typically transient. at that time it will be determined if she needs to continue on anticoagulation therapy. in the meantime, she was instructed to continue asa, coumadin, carvedilol and valsartan, as well as stick to a low salt diet. # anemia: hct 23.5 s/p cardiac cath, unknown baseline. anemia was likely [**12-22**] recent blood donation and s/p cardiac cath along with hemodilution from ivf given at osh. given recent troponin leak, patient was transfused two units prbcs. afterwards her hct remained stable. # hypotension: patient with sbp of 90 on admission. likely her blood pressure was low in the setting of takutsobo's cmp. she was given two units prbcs as above. held beta blockers and ace inhibitors as above, but able to start carvedilol and valsartan. fen: cardiac diet prophylaxis: -dvt ppx with heparin sq -bowel regimen code: full code medications on admission: norvasc 5mg daily vit d 1000u daily naltrexone 4.5mg qhs magnesium citracal xalatan eye drops timolol eye drops discharge medications: 1. aspirin 325 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 2. timolol maleate 0.5 % drops sig: one (1) drop ophthalmic daily (daily). 3. latanoprost 0.005 % drops sig: one (1) drop ophthalmic hs (at bedtime). 4. calcium citrate 250 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po twice a day. 5. vitamin d-3 400 unit tablet sig: two (2) tablet po once a day. 6. magnesium 250 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po once a day. 7. warfarin 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once daily at 4 pm. disp:*30 tablet(s)* refills:*2* 8. carvedilol 3.125 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2 times a day). disp:*60 tablet(s)* refills:*2* 9. valsartan 40 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). disp:*30 tablet(s)* refills:*2* 10. ciprofloxacin 500 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po q12h (every 12 hours) for 2 days. disp:*4 tablet(s)* refills:*0* discharge disposition: home discharge diagnosis: primary diagnoses: takutsobo's cardiomyopathy with ef 30-35% anemia 2/2 blood donation hypotension discharge condition: stable vital signs, able to ambulate discharge instructions: you were admitted to [**hospital1 18**] for evaluation of elevated cardiac markers. you were found to have a syndrome called takutsobo's cardiomyopathy which was likely a result of your recent stress and blood draws for your upcoming surgery. this is a transient condition and should resolve in [**12-23**] months. . because your heart is weak, you need to monitor yourself for fluid overload. this can result in trouble breathing when you exert yourself, difficulty lying flat to sleep, swelling in the feet or hands, a dry cough or nausea. if you notice any of these symptoms, please call dr.

[**known firstname **] [**known lastname **] is a very nice 39-year-old woman with metastatic nsclc to the bone and brain who recently was taken off her keppra who comes with multiple seizures. (1) seizures: partial seizures were secondarily generalized. this is secondarily caused by her cns metastases of her nsclc with recent decrease in dose of her decadron and stopping her keppra for abnormal lfts. she is currently back on steroids and keppra and seizure free. a alcohol withdrawal seizures cannot be fully rule out, but they are less likely. patient was discharged with follow up with dr.

(3) high temperature: upon admission t up to 101 f. this is most likely secondary to seizure activity. patient was afebrile for the rest of the hospitalization. (4) uti: patient with abnormal ua with nitrites, leukocytes and bacteria. she was asymptomatic, but in the setting of cns pathology and seizures, there was concern of the risk of an infection and it was thought [**initials (namepattern4) **] [**last name (namepattern4) **]\bar puncture and start treatment was indicated. urine culture could be contaminant with s. aureus. we cannot give quinolones to avoid decreasing seizure threashold. therefore we will started bactrim ds for 3 days. (5) abnormal lfts: patient with hepatocellular pattern abnormalities suggesting hepatocyte damage. this is most likely etiology is hepatic involvement of her nsclc. luq usg shows lesions, suggesting hepatic involvement. but we will follow with dr. [**last name (stitle) 3274**] to evaluate treatment. (6) skin rash: this may be secondary to keppra, but in the setting of recent seizures will monitor for now. antibiotics (vancomycin/cetriaxone in er) etiology is less likely. we will follow and use sarna lotion for now since risk of switching to other medications and having seizures or other adverse reaction outweighs benefits. rash was stable upon discharge.

year-old rh man with a pmh of dm and htn, untreated. he developed left arm weakness and numbness as well as a facial droop with gradual improvement of his symtpoms. on arrival, in the ed, his bp ranged between 170-200's and he was in sinus tachycardia with a rate of 100's. his exam was notable for a l facial droop, mild dysarthria and slight l deltoid weakness (-5). he did not have any extinction or sensory loss and no drift. his leg was normal. his nihss was 2. he was taken urgently to ct/cta and ctp which showed an evolving hypodensity on the r parietal lobe and an m1 cut off on cta. his ctp showed a delay in mtt and a decrease in both cbv and cbf however with a mismatch, concerning for a residual penumbra. these results were reviewed with the o/c radiologist, as well as the stroke fellow who discussed the results with the stroke attg. as his symptoms improved clinically with little deficit, he was not given ia tpa and admitted to the icu with heparin drip. patient was also found to have cardiomyopathy with lvef of 30% - echo was most consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy but not in coronary distribution hence cardiology consult recommended initial labs that were all normal except for elevated tsh. however, free t4 and t3 were within normal range hence this is expected in acute illness. cardiology agreed with plan for repeat echo in 2 months. during the icu stay, he continued to have mildly fluctuating mental status with transient worsening of left sided weakness. he was successfully transferred to the step-down unit where he was noticed to have significant but transient change in confusion, facial droop and weakness in the setting of receiving anti-hyperntensive [**doctor last name 360**]. he had repeat scan which showed expansion of ischemia and he underwent repeat angiogram which showed r mca occlusion without visualization of both acas but no intervention was possible. given such finding, his episodes of confusion and worsening weakness most likely due to hypoperfusion of his acas in the setting lower blood pressure hence he was treated with goal sbp ~150 with ivf and bedrest. on [**12-21**], he was also started on low dose midodrine, 2.5mg [**hospital1 **] for increased bp with parameters to prevent supine htn. he remained stable and he began working with pt to ambulate assistance on [**12-24**] without adverse

who was transferred from an osh after being found to have a r parietal bleed. he reportedly was in his usoh yesterday and was able to walk this morning, however when his wife checked on him around

also hypertensive initially. on exam, he has l sided weakness, neglect and possible agnosia. given his presentation and location of bleeding plus his age, this is most likely amyloid angiopathy. underlying abnormal vessels or mass were ruled out with mri/a of the head. although he did not require intubation, given bleed he was initially admitted to the icu where he remained stable overnight then subsequently transferred to the step down unit. patient was also enrolled in the deferoxime in ich trial for which he received total 3 days of deferoxime infusion from 3/27~[**3-7**] without

[**known lastname **] is a 64 yo f w/ pmh of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation complicated by a left mca thromboembolic stroke without any residual deficits who was anticoagulated with pradaxa and presented to her pcps office with melena x 3days and found to have a duodenal diverticula with mass that appeared to be a gallstone. #upper gi bleed- patient presented with melena and hct drop from 45-->29.2 (from 2 years prior) and orthostatic. this was in the setting of being on pradaxa and had no known preciptants of nsaids, alcohol, or smoking. she was admitted to the icu for urgent egd and monitoring given her need for continued anticoagulation. egd showed no ulcers or gastritis and there was a divericula in the 2nd part of the duodenum with a green/black mass that appeared to be a gallstone and was biopsied. pathology showed a mixed-type calculus. she was transfused 1u prbc with inappropriate bump in hct and was monitored in the icu prior to being transfered to the floor. when patient was transferred to the floor, she had stable vital signs and hematocrit. she reported that her stools were non-bloody and looked brown. she underwent a repeat egd and a colonoscopy. the egd showed a single small angioectasia that was not bleeding in the duodenal bulb. a gold probe was applied for tissue destruction successfully. a single non-bleeding diverticulum with large opening was found in the second part of the duodenum. a small hiatal hernia was also seen. the colonoscopy showed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and distal descending colon. since no source of the gi bleeding was identified a capsule study was recommended, which the patient had the following day. she tolerated the capsule study without any problems. [**name (ni) **] hematocrit remained stable at around 27-29 throughout the rest of her hospitalization. on discharge, she felt well and denied any bloody stools or melena. she was discharged with a ppi. #paroxysmal afib- patient has been on pradaxa prior to admission. she has a history of paroxysmal afib with a subsequent stroke while on aspirin. her chads2 score is only a 2, however given it was for a stroke she requires lifelong anticoagulation. on admission, her pradaxa was discontinued and she was started on a heparin drip as a bridge after her egd was performed to reduce her risk of stroke. her pradaxa was discontinued in the meantime. based on discussions with her cardiologist, dr. [**last name (stitle) **], it was recommended to start coumadin and discontinue pradaxa. given her risk of bleeding, patient should be on an anticoagulant that can be closely monitored and reversed to prevent future gi bleed especially since the source of bleeding could not be identified by egd and colonoscopy. this was fully explained to ms. [**known lastname **]. there were several discussions with the patient regarding the risk of bleeding by restarting pradaxa and our recommendation of starting coumadin. however, patient's mother had an adverse reaction to coumadin and she refused to start coumadin, thinking that she will definitely have the same reaction. we attempted to reassure the patient several times that adverse side effects are rare and that she will be closely monitored while on coumadin, but she continued to refuse the medication. given her ugib in the setting of pradaxa and her continuous refusal to start coumadin, dr. [**last name (stitle) **] recommended restarting on pradaxa at a lower dose (from 150mg to 75mg [**hospital1 **]). the risk of a stroke at this lower dose was explained to the patient. she acknowledged full understanding of the risks of continuing with pradaxa (increased risk of bleeding if she returns to her previous dose and increased risk of stroke at the lower dose). she also acknowledged understanding of why we thought coumadin was a better choice -- a decreased risk of both bleeding and having a stroke while on the appropriate dose of coumadin. she believed that the potential adverse reaction of coumadin outweigh the benefits. therefore, she was discharged with 75mg pradaxa and bridged with lovenox. she will follow up with her cardiologist, dr.

[due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly underestimated.] moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2159-9-25**], moderate aortic stenosis is now present. . [**2166-8-21**]: rij hd catheter placement: uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided triple lumen temporary dialysis catheter placement via the right internal jugular vein approach with the tip positioned in the right atrium. . [**2166-8-25**]: ruq ultrasound: the study is significantly limited secondary to patient body habitus. limited views of the liver show no focal lesions. the common bile duct is presumed to be patent and measures approximately 2 mm. the polyp seen within the gallbladder on the previous exam is not seen on today's study. evaluation of the main portal vein with doppler shows hepatopetal flow, appropriately, but there are periods of intermittent neutral flow which could reflect portal hypertension. there is some fluid present in morison's pouch. brief hospital course: in brief, the patient is a 52 year old woman with history of cad s/p cabg, diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, chronic kidney disease (type 4 rta), and pvd who presented with subacute change in mental status. . # decreased mental status: the patient presented with decreased consciousness following a low impact fall at home. an initial head ct was negative for mass effect or bleeds. the etiology of her change in mental status was likely multifactorial secondary to obesity hypoventilation leading to hypercapnea and hypoxia, severe sleep deprivation from osa, worsening renal failure, +/- small contribution from hyperammonenia. other diagnostic possibilities that were negative included screen for drug intoxication, sepsis, thyroid dysfunction, or seizure. the patient was evaluated by the neurology service who thought the change was likely a toxic-metabolic picture. the endocrinology service was consulted and ruled out thyroid disfunction. the patient was found to have a mildly elevated ammonia level, but the remainder of her synthetic liver function was normal. she received lactulose titrated to [**11-25**] bowel movements per day. regarding her renal impairment, a renal consult was obtained and initiated hemodialysis after adequate access was acheived. the patient will need to have a sleep study as an outpatient to confirm the diagnosis of sleep apnea and to titrate cpap. in patient attempts at cpap were unsuccessful due to claustraphobia once the patient was more awake. upon transfer to the medical floor, the patient was awake and answering questions appropriately. she has had a normal mental status on the floor off all sedating meds. . # resp: the patients initial hypercapnea was thought secondary to copd and hypoventilation. she received nebulized bronchodilators according to her outpatient regimen. the patient did suffer a pea arrest likely triggered by worsening hypoxia of unclear etiology. cpr was initiated according to acls guidelines. she regained her blood pressure quickly following one round of epinephrine and atropine. she was intubated and mechanically ventilated, blood gases were monitored. she was weaned and extubated without complication. by time of transfer from the icu she was maintaing a normal o2sat on room air. attempts at cpap initiation were unsuccessful as described above. she has remained stable on room air while on the floor. . # acute on chronic rf. the patient's underlying chronic kidney disease is likely [**12-26**] htn/dm, type 4 rta on last admission, with concomitant uti (found on presentation). the acute worsening of her renal function was somewhat unclear as the time course was quite rapid of a decline, however, no triggering toxic exposure was identified. she completed a course of antibiotics for her uti. her urine output continued to decrease and a temporary hd catheter was placed. she was evaluated by the renal service who managed the dialysis sessions. she is currently on a qtues, thurs, sat schedule and is set up as an outpatient at [**last name (un) 106879**] [**location (un) **] to continue hemodialysis once she has completed her rehab stay. she is on a nephrocap and her electrolytes have been stable. . # hd catheter line infection: patient noted to have purulent discharge from her hemodialysis catheter site during hemodialysis. swab was sent and cultures were drawn off the line and peripherally but all culture data is negative to date. she received iv gentamicin which was discontinued given negative gram stain. she was continued on 7 days daptomycin for empiric treatment. suspect early diagnosis to explain negative cultures versus sterile seroma but opted to treat to protect new line placed on the left. the catheter on the right was discontinued. continue bacitracin cream to the incision site, which will need removal of stitches in the next couple of days. . # hypotn/hypoxia on hd: patient had an episode of transient hypotension and hypoxia while on hemodialysis on the day of the diagnosis of a suspected line infection. her blood pressure improved with a 200 cc bolus and her hypoxia resolved spontaneously. suspect transient bacteremia versus vancomycin allergic reaction (onset after 25 of 200 cc of vancomycin) versus overdialyzed. no recurrent episodes. . # cad s/p cabg. there were no acute issues during her icu stay as the patient denied cp and the ekg was non specific. unclear anatomy, ?grafts. currently not on optimal cad treatment due to past adverse reactions to beta-blockers and statins. the tnt was slightly elevated at 0.02, which was likely [**12-26**] renal dysfunction. tte with new as and chf on exam (pitting edema, unable to assess jvd d/t body habitus). she received aspirin. volume management was controlled by ultrafiltration. she was started on a low dose acei on the floor given low ef and esrd on hemodialysis (discussed with renal prior to initiation). . # dm. very poorly controlled as outpatient, last hba1c was 9.8% on [**6-29**]. on high dose glargine at home. during the hospital stay the patient had both hypo- and hyper-glycemia. [**initials (namepattern4) **] [**last name (namepattern4) **] consult was obtained. on the floor, her glargine has been increased based on her daily regular insulin requirement. . # anemia: patient has a baseline anemia with labs suggestive of iron deficiency. she is s/p 2 doses of iv iron and will need 3 more doses to correct her iron deficit. she will follow-up with her pcp to schedule an outpatient colonoscopy. folate/b12 were normal. spep and upep this admission negative. her admission was complicated with bleeding associated with a hemodialysis line placement. she required 2 u prbc for resuscitation. . # ppx. sc heparin, ppi, bowel reg . # fen: dm, cardiac diet . # dispo: # code: full (confirmed) . # access: piv, subclav hd cath . # communication: son [**name (ni) **] [**name (ni) **] [**telephone/fax (1) 106880**]; [**telephone/fax (1) 106881**], son trying to get poa (temporary) to be able to pay her bills. medications on admission: lasix 20 mg po daily - dipyridamole-aspirin 200-25 mg po bid - hydrocodone-acetaminophen 10-325 one tablet po q4h:prn - docusate sodium 100 mg capsule po bid - senna 8.6 mg tabletbid - gabapentin 100 mg po qhs - glyburide 10 mg po bid - cefpodoxime 100 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po q12h x 7 days [**8-15**] - ipratropium bromide 2 puff inhalation qid - albuterol 90 mcg/actuation aerosol sig: 1-2 puffs inhalation - fludrocortisone 0.1 mg po daily - glargine 37 u sq qhs discharge medications: 1. aspirin 325 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 2. heparin (porcine) 5,000 unit/ml solution sig: 5000 (5000) units injection tid (3 times a day). 3. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2 times a day) as needed for constipation. 4. colace 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po twice a day. 5. tiotropium bromide 18 mcg capsule, w/inhalation device sig: one (1) capsule inhalation once a day. 6. albuterol 90 mcg/actuation aerosol sig: 1-2 puffs inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing. 7. salmeterol 50 mcg/dose disk with device sig: one (1) puff inhalation twice a day. 8. acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets po q4-6h (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for pain: max = 2 grams per day. 9. miconazole nitrate 2 % powder sig: one (1) appl topical tid (3 times a day). 10. neomycin-bacitracin-polymyxin ointment sig: one (1) appl topical qid (4 times a day): to right neck prn. 11. b complex-vitamin c-folic acid 1 mg capsule sig: one (1) cap po daily (daily). 12. daptomycin 500 mg recon soln sig: four [**age over 90 1230**]y (450) mg intravenous once for 1 days: please give one dose [**2166-9-12**] after hemodialysis (then course complete). 13. ferric gluconate 125 mg qd x 3 days (may be given with hemodialysis) 14. lisinopril 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 15. glargine 38 units sq qhs 16. humalog insulin per sliding scale discharge disposition: extended care facility: [**hospital3 105**] northeast - [**location (un) 38**] discharge diagnosis: primary: obesity hypoventilation acute on chronic renal failure urinary tract infection hyperkalemia type 2 diabetes with poor control transaminitis s/p mechanical fall hemodialysis line infection secondary: history of coronary artery disease history of peripheral vascular disease history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, with complications discharge condition: good: alert, lytes stable, tolerating hemodialysis discharge instructions: please monitor for temperature > 101, change in mental status, low or high blood sugars, bleeding at hemodialysis catheter site, or other concerning symptoms. you may have an allergy to vancomycin, please avoid this medication in the future. followup instructions: [**last name (un) **] clinc [**9-30**] at 10:30 am, with dr.

sinus bradycardia at a rate of 44 beats per minute, first degree av block, right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, wide qrs complex and peaked t waves, consistent with hyperkalemia. hospital course: 1. fen - hyperkalemia - in the emergency department, the patient was administered calcium gluconate, insulin, an ampule of d50, intravenous normal saline with two ampules of sodium bicarbonate. a renal consultation was then called, and a double lumen quinton catheter was then placed in the patient's right groin in anticipation of hemodialysis to dialyze off the patient's elevated potassium. the patient was then admitted to the medical intensive care unit and subsequently underwent hemodialysis on [**2167-5-12**]. following dialysis, the patient's potassium trended back toward his baseline of approximately 5.0. throughout the remainder of the patient's admission, his potassium remained between 4.4 and 5.4. with the patient's potassium stable, the patient's quinton catheter was removed on [**2167-5-13**]. the etiology of the patient's hyperkalemia was felt to be multifactorial, including a combination of baseline elevated potassium, noncompliance with outpatient kayexalate, diet at home, and medication induced with recent prescription of ace inhibitors at the outside hospital. other traditional causes of hyperkalemia include advanced renal failure, marked volume depletion and hypoaldosteronism. the patient's clinical and laboratory examination provided little evidence for either advanced renal failure or marked volume depletion, raising the question of hypoaldosteronism in its etiology. with these thoughts in mind, the patient subsequently had an aldosterone level drawn, and he was started empirically on fludrocortisone, for presumed hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, a condition that typically affects patients 50 to 70 years of age with diabetic nephropathy or chronic interstitial nephritis with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. in addition, it was noted that the patient may have been on heparin while at the outside hospital, and that heparin has been known to have a direct toxic effect on the adrenal zonaglomerulosa cells. the patient's course in the medical intensive care unit with respect to his hyperkalemia upon admission was otherwise uncomplicated, and he was subsequently transferred from the medical intensive care unit to the floor on [**2167-5-14**]. at the time of his transfer from the medical intensive care unit on [**2167-5-14**], the patient's renal medications included furosemide 20 mg p.o. once daily, fludrocortisone acetate 0.1 mg p.o. once daily, and sodium bicarbonate 1300 mg p.o. twice a day. in order to reduce the patient's potassium to a desire range of between 4.0 and 4.5, the patient's dose of fludrocortisone was increased from 0.1 mg p.o. once daily to 0.1 mg p.o. twice a day. at the time of his discharge on [**2167-5-18**], the patient had a potassium of 4.4. on the morning of the patient's discharge, the patient's previous aldosterone level came back from the laboratory. the patient's aldosterone was found to be 13.0 with a reference range of 1.0-16.0 for a patient when supine. at discharge, the patient was continued on his fludrocortisone at a dose of 0.1 mg p.o. twice a day with instructions to follow-up with dr. [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**last name (namepattern1) **] in the [**hospital 2793**] clinic at [**hospital1 69**]. hypercalcemia - at the time of his admission, the patient's free calcium was noted to be 1.37. the elevated calcium occurring in the context of hyperkalemia raised the question of multiple myeloma, and the patient subsequently had an spep and upep sent. these tests revealed no specific abnormalities, and there was no monoclonal immunoglobulin seen. the patient's calcium at the time of discharge was 9.4. 2. endocrine - the patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin. during the time of his admission, the patient was maintained on a regimen of glargine 54 units q.h.s. with a humalog sliding scale. hypoaldosteronism - as mentioned previously, the patient's presentation with hyperkalemia raised the question of hypoaldosteronism in its etiology. given the patient's history of type iv rta, it was thought that the patient's hypoaldosteronism might be due to hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, a condition that typically affects patients in their 50s to 70s with diabetic nephropathy or chronic interstitial nephritis with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. as mentioned above, at the time of his discharge, the patient's aldosterone returned at a level of 13.0, which was within normal limits of 1.0-16.0. while the patient was continued on his fludrocortisone at admission, he was scheduled to follow-up with dr. [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**last name (namepattern1) **] of nephrology in the [**hospital 2793**] clinic as an outpatient. 3. renal - after the patient's one episode of hemodialysis on [**2167-5-12**], the patient's right quinton catheter was subsequently pulled and he required no further episodes of hemodialysis. during the remainder of his admission, the patient's creatinine remained between 1.0 and 1.5. as mentioned above, given the patient's presumed type iv rta and hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, the patient was continued on his fludrocortisone, initially at 0.1 mg p.o. once daily and subsequently on 0.1 mg p.o. twice a day. in addition, as has been noted in prior discharge summaries, it was again emphasized that the patient should avoid treatment with ace inhibitors and arbs. 4. cardiovascular - coronary artery disease - from the time of his emergency department presentation on [**2167-5-12**], the patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with three sets of cardiac enzymes, all of which were negative. the patient was continued on his aspirin, lopressor and statin. 5. infectious disease - conjunctivitis - the patient was continued on his erythromycin strips for bilateral conjunctivitis. 6. musculoskeletal - hip/groin pain - the patient's radiographs at the time of presentation in the emergency department provided no evidence of either hip or pelvic fracture or dislocation. while the patient continued to complain of some right groin pain, this pain was treated to good effect with heat packs and acetaminophen. weakness - while the patient's weakness precipitating his fall on [**2167-5-12**], might have been attributed to his hyperkalemia, the patient was also ruled out for hypothyroidism. the patient's tsh was 1.2 and his free t4 was 1.5, both within normal limits. in addition, the patient was seen by physical therapy, who felt that much of his weakness was due to deconditioning. following several sessions with the patient, physical therapy felt that the patient was safe to be discharged home with 24 hour supervision. condition on discharge: stable. discharge status: discharged to home with services. discharge diagnoses: 1. hyperkalemia. 2. type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin. 3. coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction. 4. hypertension. 5. peripheral nephropathy. 6. renal call cancer. 7. prostate cancer. 8. history of clostridium difficile colitis. medications on discharge: 1. glargine insulin 54 units q.h.s. 2. humalog insulin sliding scale. 3. gabapentin 300 mg p.o. four times a day. 4. furosemide 20 mg p.o. once daily. 5. erythromycin ophthalmic ointment one strip o.u. six times per day. 6. fludrocortisone 0.1 mg p.o. twice a day. 7. lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. twice a day. 8. sodium bicarbonate 1300 mg p.o. twice a day. 9. aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily. 10. loperamide 2 mg p.o. four times a day p.r.n. 11. reglan 10 mg p.o. q6hours. 12. zocor 20 mg p.o. once daily. 13. paxil 10 mg p.o. once daily. discharge instructions: the patient is to follow-up with his primary care physician, [**last name (namepattern4) **].

the patient ingested two sustained released medications wellbutrin and depakote therefore there is some worry that his cns depression will continue to deteriorate but it did not. the patient gradually improved on the first night of admission. his valproic level decreased over night from 250 to 150. he became gradually less lethargic and more oriented though he did require 6 mg of ativan over night for agitation. he was kept in the micu over night for monitoring but was transferred out on hospital day one. initially his ammonia level was elevated at 87 decreased to 61 on hospital day one. his lfts normalized rapidly. he was maintained on the ciwa scale with a one to one sitter without events. psychiatry was involved throughout and it was decided the patient should be discharged to an inpatient psychiatric facility. the patient was also written for haldol prn for agitation, 5 mg iv q 30 minutes prn. however he did not require any doses while he was in the hospital. 2. cardiovascular - the patient underwent three ekgs during his admission all of which were largely unremarkable with no qt prolongation as can happen with a seroquel overdose. telemetry monitoring during his admission revealed only mild tachycardic events that were brief and occurred only approximately two times. he was maintained on telemetry throughout his admission. 3. respiratory - the patient saturations were well throughout his admission and showed no signs of respiratory depression. 4. gastrointestinal - the patient did not have significant gi symptoms including no constipation and no abdominal pain, no evidence of hepatic toxicity which can be associated with depakote. the patient has had bright red blood per rectum since [**2176-9-7**] that is most consistent with hemorrhoids. he has been advised to follow up with this as an outpatient. 5. fluids, electrolytes and nutrition -

[**known lastname **] is 53 yo woman with t1-t2 level paraplegia since [**2142**], with previous history of episode of pres, was in [**hospital1 **] with pneumonia and uti last week, home for 4 days when she developed headache and confusion. she came in to er, was hypertensive to sbp of 170's-180's and dbp in 110-120 range, had a focal seizure and severe encephalopathy. on [**2150-4-20**] she was admitted to the icu and her hypertension was treated with nicardipine iv. she was loaded with [**date range 13401**] for possible seizures. she was given acyclovir empirically for possibility of hsv encephalitis and underwent a lumbar puncture. she was treated empirically for mdr uti and possible pna with vancomycin/cepefime/flagyl. she underwent nchct which showed hypodensities consistent with pres with possibility of acute-subacute infarct. given her overall improvement, she was transfered to the floor on [**2150-4-22**]. she remained afebrile and her bp was well controlled. her csf did not show hsv and acyclovir was discontinued. her other abx were also stopped. on [**2150-4-22**], she had an extended routine eeg which did not show electrographic seizures or clear spikes. her [**date range 13401**] was continued for seizure prophylaxis as she did not have any other episodes concerning for seizure. to evaluate the hypodensity seen on previous scan, she was ordered for mri brain but refused. she was then ordered for a repeat nchct which showed stable changes consistent with pres. she will be discharge home to resume her typical pre-admission home services. transitional issues: . 1. pres: this is the second episode since [**2147**]. given her paraplegia, she is at risk for dysautonomia and hypertensive crises which have required inpatient hospitalizations for bp control. her bp is somewhat labile and attempts to start low dose bp control meds (lisinopril) have led to significant hypotension. going forward, she might benefit from bp cuff with prn bp control at home. she should continue her typical home care to limit pain, constipation or other triggers of hypertension. . 2. pulmonary function: she has chronic recurrent pna and followed by pulmonary service. she has pfts tomorrow and ongoing home chest-pt which she will continue on discharge. . 3. sleep apnea: during this hospitalization, she had several episodes of desaturations (80s) at night despite being on 2lnc. it is [possible that her likely sleep apnea is contributing to htn. we will recommend a sleep study as outpatient. . 4. seizures: these were likely provoked by pres. for the moment, she will remain on [**name (ni) 13401**] prophylactically until neurology follow-up. medications on admission: albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 ml (0.083 %) solution for nebulization [**name (ni) **]: one (1) inhalation q4h (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing. baclofen 10 mg tablet [**name (ni) **]: two (2) tablet po bid (2 times a day). baclofen 10 mg tablet [**name (ni) **]: one (1) tablet po once daily at 4 pm. calcium carbonate 200 mg calcium (500 mg) tablet, chewable [**name (ni) **]: two (2) tablet, chewable po twice a day. citalopram 40 mg tablet [**name (ni) **]: one (1) tablet po once a day. 6. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % solution [**name (ni) **]: one (1) inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing. 7. levothyroxine 112 mcg tablet [**name (ni) **]: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 8. clonazepam 1 mg tablet [**name (ni) **]: one (1) tablet po three times a day as needed for anxiety. 9. lidocaine 5 %(700 mg/patch) adhesive patch, medicated [**name (ni) **]: three (3) adhesive patches, medicated topical daily (daily). 10. methadone 5 mg tablet [**name (ni) **]: one (1) tablet po tid (3 times a day). 11. omeprazole 20 mg capsule, delayed release(e.c.)

[**name (ni) **] lives with his wife and son. former iv drug use (heroin). past history of ethanol abuse. smoked two packs per day times 20 years; quit 10 years ago. on methadone since [**2162**]. family history: his father passed away of unknown causes. mother passed away of myocardial infarction at age 75. brother was killed in [**country 3992**]. sister is alive and well. physical examination on admission: on admission to the medical intensive care unit with a temperature was 100.5, blood pressure 116/74, heart rate 100, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 96% on 4 liters. in general, a thin chronically ill-appearing 57-year-old gentleman in no acute distress. heent revealed pupils were equal, round and reactive to light. extraocular movements were intact. sclerae were icteric. thrush seen on the tongue. neck was supple. no lymphadenopathy. no jugular venous distention. cardiovascular revealed tachycardic with a systolic ejection murmur heard at the right lower sternal border. chest had fine crackles, left greater than right, at the bases. no wheezes. abdomen was soft and nondistended, generalized tenderness especially in the epigastric area. no rebound, active bowel sounds. liver and spleen both palpable. extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema. palpable dorsalis pedis pulses. neurologically, alert and oriented times three. cranial nerves were grossly intact. no asterixis. laboratory data on admission: white blood cell count 6.3, hematocrit 33.5, platelets 104 with 74% polys and 19% lymphocytes. pt 20.3, inr 2.7, ptt 35.8. fibrinogen 277, albumin 2.6. calcium 8.8, phosphate 4.3, magnesium 2. alt 142, ast 623, ldh 3700, alkaline phosphatase 147, total bilirubin 1.4, lipase 2170, amylase 896. first creatine kinase was 94. troponin was sent and was pending. sodium 138, potassium 5.8, chloride 101, bicarbonate 23, bun 44, creatinine 6.4, and glucose 89. digoxin level was also sent and was pending. arterial blood gas was 7.29, lactate 3.1, free calcium 1.14, dat was sent off. blood cultures sent times two. chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure, no infiltrates. electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, left atrial dilatation, right bundle-branch block with new q waves in iii and avf. no st changes. hospital course: this 57-year-old gentleman with human immunodeficiency virus, end-stage renal disease, hepatitis b, hepatitis c, cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, presented with ventricular tachycardia following hemodialysis as well as hypotension and was initially admitted to the medical intensive care unit for observation and was subsequently transferred the next morning to the [**hospital ward name **]. his hospital course by issue is as follows. 1. cardiovascular: the patient had no further episodes of his wide complex tachycardia which was thought to be more likely atrial flutter with aberrancy; however, ventricular tachycardia could not be ruled out. he also had a positive troponin to 13.5 with flat creatine kinases. there were electrocardiogram changes, but the overall opinion from cardiology was that the troponin leak as well as electrocardiogram changes could all be consistent with a cardiomyopathy. the digoxin was discontinued. the captopril was held. telemetry was continued, and the patient continued to show ventricular bigeminy and trigeminy with some premature ventricular contractions on telemetry, but did not have any further tachy arrhythmias. 2. gastrointestinal: the patient was had pancreatitis by elevated amylase and lipase in the setting of restarting his human immunodeficiency virus medications. he was kept n.p.o. with low maintenance iv fluids. his human immunodeficiency virus medications were held. a cat scan of the abdomen was done which showed a small stone in the gallbladder with no evidence of biliary obstruction, atrophic kidneys, small bilateral pleural effusions as well as fat stranding surrounding the tail of the pancreas, and a small amount of fluid collecting around the liver and anterior left renal fascia. findings were determined to be consistent with early pancreatitis, and the patient was treated as previously mentioned. also, an mrcp was obtained and gastrointestinal was consulted. the mrcp showed choledocholithiasis without any obstruction, most likely the cause of his intermittent pancreatitis. he declined ercp and was started on ursodiol. 3. renal: the patient was continued on hemodialysis every other day. he had minimal fluid intake with maintenance fluids, and his electrolytes were followed closely. he required only one dose of kayexalate to normalize his potassium, and otherwise did not require any other adjustments in his electrolytes. 4. hematology: the patient had multiple blood draws that were hemolyzed. he was coombs antibiotic positive with decreased haptoglobin and increased ldh. the source of his hemolysis was thought to be due to medications; possibly the captopril or the bactrim or the human immunodeficiency virus medications. his hemolysis laboratories progressively continued to improve with the ldh and the haptoglobin normalizing. his reticulocyte count was 3.3, and his hematocrit dropped to 25 but increased to 30 after 1 units of packed red blood cells. a hematology consultation was obtained, and they proposed doing a bone marrow biopsy to rule out a lymphoproliferative disorder or a lymphoma in this human immunodeficiency virus positive patient; however, the patient declined that procedure. the patient's inr increased to 8. he was given one dose of vitamin k at which time it came down to 1.8. he was restarted on 2.5 mg of coumadin and increased to 5 mg of coumadin. the patient received 8 mg of coumadin in the medical intensive care unit, after which time his inr increased significant; however, after the patient received vitamin k and was restarted on the coumadin the inr was followed to try to achieve a level of between 2 and 3 for adequate anticoagulation. 5. pulmonary: the patient has obstructive sleep apnea and a chronic oxygen requirement, chronic deep venous thrombosis and pe. he was continued on supplemental oxygen throughout the hospitalization, and his oxygen saturation was stable. 6. pe/deep venous thrombosis: again, the coumadin was restarted at 2.5 mg and then 5 mg with a goal inr of 2 to 3. 7. infectious disease: haart medications were held, as was the bactrim, in the setting of hemolysis. the patient had [**2-25**] blood culture bottles positive for staphylococcus coag-negative. two bottles were oxacillin resistant, and two were oxacillin sensitive. the patient received seven days of vancomycin dosed by level due to his renal failure. surveillance cultures were sent times two. at the time of this dictation, those cultures showed no growth to date. the plan was to restart his bactrim once he is taking better p.o. following resolution of the pancreatitis and once the hemolysis has resolved. the patient was also known to have methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus as well as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and precautions were in place during his hospitalization. 8. psychiatry: the patient has a history of depression and iv drug use. he was continued on methadone. the zoloft and the diazepam were held while his was n.p.o., and he was maintained on valium p.r.n. discharge disposition: the patient was ultimately transferred to the [**hospital **] rehabilitation facility in good condition with the following discharge diagnoses. discharge diagnoses: 1. human immunodeficiency virus. 2. cardiomyopathy. 3. end-stage renal disease. 4. pancreatitis. 5. history of iv drug use, on methadone. 6. chronic lung disease. 7. status post tachy arrhythmia with hypotension. 8. history of pulmonary embolus/deep venous thrombosis. 9. hepatitis b. 10. hepatitis c. 11. cirrhosis. 12. splenomegaly. 13. anemia. 14. benign prostatic hypertrophy. 15. depression. 16. history of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. 17. peptic ulcer disease. medications on discharge: 1. prilosec 20 mg p.o. 2. bactrim-ds 1 tablet every monday, wednesday and friday. 3. methadone 50 mg p.o. q.d. 4. valium 5 mg to 10 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. 5. oxycodone one to two tablets q.4-6h. p.r.n. 6. coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. 7. aspirin. at the time of this dictation he had not been restarted on his captopril or on a beta blocker, but the hope that this will happen if his blood pressure can tolerate it. additional discharge medications will be dictated separately in a discharge summary addendum. condition at discharge: the patient was discharged in good condition.

[**country 7018**] red was negative for amyloid. his [**doctor first name **] was also positive at 1:640, lupus anticoagulant was negative, and anti-cardiolipin igg/m were pending at discharge. preliminary biopsy results were suspicious for fibrillary glomerulonephritis. he was discharged with follow-up at nephrology clinic for further evaluation as outpatient. he was discharged on sevelamer for hyerphosphatemia. he was also restarted on his lasix as cr stabilized. # gu bleed s/p kidney biopsy: pt underwent kidney biopsy on [**2153-3-21**] that was complicated by gross hematuria. he was seen by urology and put on cbi. his hematuria led to drop in hct from high 20s to low 20s and a drop in blood pressure to systolic 70s. he was transferred to the icu for the hypotension. ct abdomen showed perinephric stranding adjacent to the left kidney, most likely from recent percutaneous biopsy, a small hematoma in left kidney, and blood in the collecting system and bladder. he required a total of 5 units prbcs and 1 bag platelets throughout hospital admission. hct was stable at baseline in high 20s by time of discharge. repeat ct abdomen showed that small hematoma in kidney was stable. he no longer had hematuria at discharge and was able to urinate without a foley. # ?transfusion reaction: of note, pt exhibited rigors during his first transfusion. he was not febrile. per transfusion medicine, this was likely not a febrile non-hemoltyic transfusion reaction given the short duration of his symptoms, no subsequent fever and that leukoreduction significantly decreases the risk of these reactions. he experienced no adverse reactions from his subsequent transfusions. # hypotension: bp at admission was systolic 80s. he was given iv fluids and his antihypertensives and diuretics were held (with the exception of nadolol). he later became hypotensive to systolic 70s following hematuria after a kidney biopsy and hemodialysis. pt also with mild hyperthermia to 95 concerning also for infection on admission. he was pan-cultured, with negative urine and blood cultures. patient started on ctx 2gm q24hrs x2 days for possible sbp, but was dicscontinued [**3-23**] as likelihood of sbp felt to be very small with no abdominal pain, normal wbc and no fevers. peritoneal fluid showed no signs of infection. following transfusion of prbcs and iv fluids, bp stabilized in systolic 100s-120s throughout remainder of admission. # le edema: pt presented with le edema, left worse than right. on admission he endorsed some calf pain as well. b/l lenis were obtained, which were negative for dvt. pain resolved and pt was able to ambulate without difficulty. he was discharged back on his lasix. # hepatocellular carcinoma: pt was s/p sorafenib [**2153-1-22**] to [**2153-3-6**]. he has recently transferred his onc care here. he was continued on nadolol at admission but this was briefly held in the icu when gi bleed was being ruled out for drop in hct. he underwent a therapeutic paracentesis on [**2153-3-26**]; peritoneal fluid was benign and 3l were removed from abdomen. he will discuss with his outpatient oncologist whether sorafenib can be restarted once kidney function stabilizes. medications on admission: 1. oxycodone 5mg po q4h prn 2. aldactone 100mg po daily 3. lasix 40mg po daily 4. nadolol 20mg daily 5. protonix 40mg daily 6. amlodipine/benzapril 10/40 7. nexavar (on hold) 8. levaquin 500mg po x 1 week discharge medications: 1. oxycodone 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po q4h (every 4 hours) as needed for pain. 2. furosemide 40 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 3. nadolol 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 4. protonix 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one (1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po once a day. 5. sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po tid w/meals (3 times a day with meals). disp:*90 tablet(s)* refills:*0* discharge disposition: home discharge diagnosis: primary: acute renal failure secondary: hepatocellular carcinoma discharge condition: mental status: clear and coherent. level of consciousness: alert and interactive. activity status: ambulatory - independent. discharge instructions: it was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital. you were admitted with acute kidney failure. the severity of your kidney failure required several sessions of hemodialysis. your kidney function improved with the hemodialysis. you were evaluated by our renal consult team who performed a kidney biopsy. this was complicated by bleeding that caused your blood counts to drop and your blood pressure to drop. you were transferred to the intensive care unit briefly because of this and were transfused with blood products. your blood pressure recovered and the bleeding in the urine stopped. your kidney biopsy showed a rare condition called fibrillary glomerulonephritis. it is very important that you have regular follow-ups at the [**hospital 10701**] clinic for frequent monitoring of your kidney function and possibly further testing. the following medications were changed: 1) stop amlodipine/benzapril unless one of your outpatient doctors wants to restart. your blood pressure was extremely good in the hospital so you didn't need it on discharge. 2) stop aldactone. ask your outpatient doctors when [**name5 (ptitle) **] [**name5 (ptitle) **] restart this medication. 3) stop levaquin 4) stop nexavar 5) start sevelemar 800mg three times a day with meals to lower your phosphorous levels followup instructions: you have the following appointments scheduled for you. you will need to come to the [**hospital 2793**] clinic on the [**location (un) 448**] of the [**hospital ward name 121**] building ([**hospital ward name **]) on monday [**2153-4-2**] to get your labs drawn. please come between the hours of 9am and 2pm and bring with you the lab order slip. department: hematology/oncology when: friday [**2153-4-6**] at 3:30 pm with: [**last name (lf) 3150**],[**name8 (md) **] md [**telephone/fax (1) 11133**] building: sc [**hospital ward name 23**] clinical ctr [**location (un) 24**] campus: east best parking: [**hospital ward name 23**] garage department: west [**hospital 2002**] clinic when: wednesday [**2153-4-4**] at 2:30 pm with: [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**last name (namepattern1) **] [**name8 (md) **], md [**telephone/fax (1) 721**] building: de [**hospital1 **] building ([**hospital ward name 121**] complex) [**location (un) **] campus: west best parking: [**street address(1) 592**] garage completed by:[**2153-3-29**]",0
136,"admission date: [**2126-7-29**] discharge date: [**2126-8-22**] service: chief complaint: dark urine and painful skin lesions. history of present illness: the patient is a 78-year-old male with a past medical history significant for myelodysplastic syndrome diagnosed eight years ago and multiple basal cell carcinomas who presented with a 3-day history of dark red/bloody urine. the patient also complained of a painful skin lesion on the left flank. regarding the hematuria, the patient reported painless hematuria with urine that was essentially dark red and never grossly bloody times one week. he denied any history of trauma as well as any dysuria, increased urinary frequency, hesitancy, or difficulty voiding. he also denied abdominal pain. the patient denied bright red blood per rectum, melena, hematemesis, hemoptysis, or epistaxis. he did admit to easy bruising and prolonged time to clot. the patient reported that his myelodysplastic syndrome had been stable until the spring of this year when he started to feel very tired and lethargic. he had started receiving weekly packed red blood cell transfusions seven weeks prior to admission and had started weekly epogen injections three weeks prior to admission. the patient was status post a bone marrow biopsy on [**2126-6-18**] that showed decreased erythroid elements with occasional dysplastic forms and decreased myeloid elements with limited maturation. however, there was no evidence of progression to acute leukemia. regarding the skin lesions, the patient reports that the left flank lesion first appeared three to four weeks prior to admission and that over the past week it had become increasingly tender. he says the lesion started out looking like a blister and then ""popped."" the patient is unsure of the nature of the fluid that it drained. the patient also has a left axillary lesion which he says started out like a blister and has been present for three to four days prior to admission. in the emergency department, the patient received one dose of gentamicin and oxacillin. he was also transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells and 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma. he was also given potassium chloride. past medical history: 1. myelodysplastic syndrome diagnosed eight years ago; recently transfusion dependent. 2. gout. 3. basal cell carcinoma. 4. squamous cell carcinoma. 5. question history of inferior wall myocardial infarction. past surgical history: mohs surgery for basal cell carcinoma. social history: the patient is a former psychologist at [**hospital 14852**]. he is separated from his wife of 14 years. he has seven children. he drinks occasional alcohol. he has a 50 plus year history of cigar smoking and quit six to seven months ago. family history: his family history is significant for a daughter with diabetes. he had a brother who died of leukemia at the age of three and father who died of heart disease. medications on admission: his medications included epogen 20,000 units every tuesday, colchicine as needed, multivitamin with iron, and tylenol as needed. allergies: he has no known drug allergies. physical examination on presentation: the patient's vital signs on presentation were as follows; temperature was 100.6, heart rate was 88, respiratory rate was 24, blood pressure was 107/63, oxygen saturation was 97% on 2 liters. the patient's physical examination on presentation was as follows; in general, he was a pale-appearing elderly male. he was in no apparent distress. his head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed sclerae were anicteric. his conjunctivae were pale. his oropharynx was clear. there was no thyromegaly, and no cervical lymphadenopathy, and no jugular venous distention. his lungs revealed bibasilar crackles. his heart examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur. his abdomen was soft and nontender, with positive bowel sounds. he also had a palpable spleen tip. his back revealed no costovertebral angle tenderness. on his skin were multiple facial telangiectasias. his nose appeared slightly disfigured which was consistent with prior mohr surgery. he had multiple pink plaques, some with overlying scales distributed overlying scale distributed over his back, arms, and legs bilaterally. on his left flank was a well demarcated 7-cm to 8-cm indurated pink plaque with an area of central necrosis. he had a similar-appearing 5-cm to 6-cm pink plaque under his left axilla which; both of which were extremely tenderness to palpation. neurologically, he was alert and oriented times three. he had no focal deficits. his rectal examination revealed occult-blood positive brown stool. pertinent laboratory data on presentation: his laboratories on admission were as follows; complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 3.9, his hematocrit was 19.8, with a mean cell volume of 87. of note, the patient had a hematocrit of 25.8 three days prior to admission. his platelet count was 15. the differential of his white blood cell count was as follows; 27% polys, no bands, and 51% lymphocytes. his chemistry-7 was as follows; sodium was 132, potassium was 2.7, chloride was 98, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 30, creatinine was 1.4, and blood glucose was 105. the patient's baseline creatinine is 1.1 to 1.2. the patient's coagulations were as follows; pt was 15.2, ptt was 41.9, inr was 1.6. the patient had a reticulocyte count that was sent in the emergency department and came back at 0.7. his urinalysis revealed brown cloudy urine, with large blood; it was nitrite positive, protein was greater than 300, glucose was negative, ketones were trace, there was a small amount of bilirubin, a moderate amount of leukocyte esterase; his red blood cell count was greater than 1000 with 3 to 5 white blood cells and many bacteria. there was also occasional uric acid crystals noted. blood cultures and urine cultures were sent from the emergency department on [**7-29**] which were negative. hospital course: the [**hospital 228**] hospital course related chronologically was as follows. on the evening of [**7-29**], he was admitted to the cc seven. he was initially treated with dicloxacillin for his skin lesions and started on intravenous ciprofloxacin for question pyelonephritis given the infectious-appearing urinalysis. it was unclear whether the patient's presentation with pancytopenia was secondary to blasts crisis; although, this was felt to be unlikely given that he has had a recent bone marrow biopsy which was negative for blasts, and his peripheral smear was also negative for blasts. his coagulopathy was treated with transfusions of fresh frozen plasma and vitamin k. on [**7-30**], the patient was seen by his outpatient hematologist who questioned whether the patient's skin lesions and hematuria could be secondary to septic emboli. the patient was ordered to get a transthoracic echocardiogram which he refused on several occasions. his antibiotics were also changed from dicloxacillin to oxacillin. on [**7-31**], the patient's coagulations were all evaluated despite vitamin k, and there was noted to be minimal correction of the anemia and thrombocytopenia despite transfusions. a disseminated intravascular coagulation screen was sent off and found to be positive. a dermatology consultation was also called on this day for help in evaluating the skin lesions. they felt that the lesions were most consistent with a neutrophilic dermatosis such as pyodermic gangrenosum versus sweet's disease which has a high incidence in myelodysplastic syndrome. also on the differential diagnosis was exanthematic gangrenosum due to pseudomonas infection as well as a deep fungal infection and cutaneous leukemia/lymphoma. the left axillary lesion was biopsied and sent for bacterial, and fungal, and atypical mycobacterial cultures. the dermatology consultation agreed with intravenous antibiotics. on [**8-1**], the patient was felt to be functionally neutropenic; and given the question of pseudomonas infection, he was started on intravenous ceftazidime. he was also continued on intravenous oxacillin. the infectious disease service was consulted regarding the disseminated intravascular coagulation and choice of antibiotics. they agreed with ongoing ceftazidime and oxacillin. on their differential was bacterial infections; namely furunculosis or xanthomatous granulosum. they also considered sporotrichum infections, mycobacterial infections, tick-borne diseases. they also considered sweet's disease in malignancy associated conditions. they recommended a ct of the abdomen if the workup was unrevealing. a renal ultrasound was also performed on [**8-1**] which showed multiple stones in the collecting system, but no evidence of hydronephrosis or renal abscess. on [**8-2**], the patient's skin biopsy gram stain revealed 2+ polys and no organisms, and the aerobic culture grew out coagulase-positive staphylococcus. at that point, it was decided to treat the patient for 10 days with intravenous oxacillin. the preliminary pathology report on the skin biopsy was as follows; clusters of plasma cells with infiltrative lymphocytes and neutrophils. on the differential was pyoderma versus infection versus plasma cell neoplasm. on [**8-3**], a serum protein electrophoresis and urine protein electrophoresis; which had been sent out earlier in the week, came back positive for monoclonal spike in the spep and two abnormal bands on the upep. a monoclonal intact immunoglobulin g lambda and monoclonal free lambda ([**initials (namepattern5) **] [**last name (namepattern5) **]-[**doctor last name **]). these results were discussed with the patient's outpatient hematologist who agreed with consulting the inpatient hematology service. the hematology service recommended starting the patient on decadron but holding off on melphalan. they said that overall, the association between myelodysplastic syndrome and multiple myeloma is not known, but they felt that people with malignancy and myeloma could develop severe disseminated intravascular coagulation which was consistent with the patient's clinical picture. on [**8-4**], the patient had a ct of the abdomen, chest, and pelvis to look for sources of occult infection. the ct of the chest was significant for a 1.2-cm nodule in the right upper lung adjacent to the major fissure. the ct of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 1.2-cm cyst in the body of the pancreas. there was no lymphadenopathy that was noted in the mediastinum, in the axilla, or in the pelvis. on [**8-6**], the patient's diagnosis of myeloma was questioned by dr. [**last name (stitle) 2539**] (who was the patient's outpatient hematologist), and it was felt that the monoclonal spike most likely represented myoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance rather than myeloma. at that point, the steroids were discontinued, and the decision was made to repeat the skin biopsy given the questionable read of plasmacytoma. in the meantime, the infectious disease workup continued; and [**doctor last name 3271**]-[**doctor last name **] virus, cytomegalovirus, cryptococcal, and coccidia serologies were checked; which all came back as negative. also, babesia thick and thin smears were checked given a history of transfusions. on [**8-7**], the ceftazidime was discontinued after eight days secondary to no known organisms. the patient developed increasing transfusion dependence. previously, he had only required transfusions prior to procedure. at this point, he required transfusions to stop bleeding from his intravenous sites and from his biopsy sites. on [**8-8**], the patient had frank bleeding from his skin biopsy site that required two hours of manual pressure and resuturing to achieve hemostasis. also, the issues of access were raised given that the patient had only one peripheral intravenous line and was in need of multiple blood products. at that point, a peripherally inserted central catheter line was placed in interventional radiology. also, on the evening of [**8-8**], the patient had an adverse reaction while getting transfused with cryoprecipitate. on [**8-9**], the patient had a repeat bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. at that point, it was felt that given that the skin biopsies were nondiagnostic that the question of whether the patient was transforming into an acute leukemia needed to be readdressed. this bone marrow biopsy returned the week later and was consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome with no evidence of acute leukemia. subsequently, from [**8-9**] to [**8-15**], the patient continued to require aggressive blood product support through his disseminated intravascular coagulation with daily transfusions of platelets, packed red blood cells, cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma. disseminated intravascular coagulation laboratories were checked twice a day, and factors and cells were replaced liberally as the patient continued to ooze through his peripherally inserted central catheter site and biopsy sites. on [**8-14**], the patient became acutely hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 90s. he was also symptomatic and complaining of lightheadedness. the patient was boluses with fluids and received blood products with a return of his blood pressure to the 140s. he had a repeat episode on [**8-16**], to which he again responded to fluids and blood products. on [**8-15**], the patient's repeat skin biopsy was read as consistent with intracellular organisms. toxoplasmosis stains done were positive, and the diagnosis of cutaneous toxoplasmosis was made with a question of toxoplasma-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation. on [**8-16**], the patient was started on medications for toxoplasmosis consisting of sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine, and folinic acid. he was also started on g-csf given his profound neutropenia and the possibility of a granulocytosis with a sulfa regimen. multiple urine cultures from [**8-14**] to [**8-16**] were positive for enterococcus. the infectious disease consultants felt that this was most likely a contaminant and was not initially treated. however, on [**8-16**], the patient was started on vancomycin for an enterococcus urinary tract infection. on the morning of [**8-17**], the patient had multiple sets of blood cultures which came back positive as gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. he had also been spiking fevers, and this was felt to be secondary to staphylococcus bacteremia. the patient was maintained on his toxoplasmosis medications as well as vancomycin. he was also on flagyl at this point for stools positive for clostridium difficile. on the evening of [**8-17**], the patient complained of [**4-12**] chest pain. the night float intern was called to see the patient, and an electrocardiogram was checked which was unchanged. his chest pain was treated with sublingual nitroglycerin, morphine, and ativan. several hours later, the patient again complained of chest pain, and at this time was markedly tachypneic with a respiratory rate in the 30s and a heart rate in the 100s. a blood gas was checked at this time which revealed a respiratory alkalosis with a large aa gradient. there was concern that the patient may have had a pulmonary embolism. an electrocardiogram was checked which showed ischemic changes across the precordium as well as in the lateral leads. troponin were cycled and found to be elevated. on examination, the patient was found to be in an irregular rhythm. an electrocardiogram was again checked, and that showed that the patient was in atrial fibrillation. he had previously, throughout the course of the admission, been in a normal sinus rhythm. the patient was also tachycardic to the 180s and was given intravenous diltiazem with minimal effect. the medical intensive care unit service was consulted and recommended cardioversion with amiodarone. however, the amiodarone could not be administered on the floor, and the patient required transfer to the medical intensive care unit for cardioversion. in the intensive care unit, on amiodarone, the patient did cardioverted back to sinus rhythm. he was also placed with a femoral line given that his peripherally inserted central catheter line was infected and felt to be the source of his staphylococcus bacteremia. on the evening of [**8-19**], the patient was transferred back from the medical intensive care unit to the floor initially in sinus rhythm; however, the patient converted back to atrial fibrillation shortly thereafter. on the following day, the sensitivities of the patient's blood cultures revealed the organisms were resistant to oxacillin, and the patient was continued on vancomycin. it was noted that his disseminated intravascular coagulation appeared to be stabilized. the patient was requiring fewer blood transfusions and was maintaining his counts for longer periods of time status post transfusions. however, it was notable that from a mental status standpoint, the patient was becoming quite frustrated with the number of complications that he was facing and was increasingly less optimistic about his prognosis. previously during the admission, in fact it was on [**8-16**], the patient; in consultation with his son and with his attending, decided on a do not resuscitate/do not intubate code status. this was later changed to comfort measures only on [**2126-8-21**]. his house officer, his attending, and his consultants related the fact that while his overall prognosis was poor, that he was actually showing signs of improvement regarding his disseminated intravascular coagulation and his staphylococcus infection. however, while the patient expressed a clear understanding of this, he wanted to continue with his decision to be comfort measures only. at that point, all intravenous fluids, medications, blood draws, and blood product support were withdrawn. he was ordered for intravenous morphine as needed, and for intravenous ativan, and valium as needed. social work and the palliative care service were involved with helping the patient deal with this decision and helping the family also cope with the imminent loss of their father. note: there will be an addendum that will be added at a later date.

[**last name (stitle) 986**], his urologist. apparently, in his recent admission in 11/00 when he had a cardiac catheterization, he had heavy hematuria; however, this was on heparin. lad intervention had been deferred at that point. the decision had been made to medically manage him. he tolerated the heparin and coumadin without any evidence of hematuria. the patient was also started on captopril given his low ejection fraction. it was anticipated that the patient would be discharged to home for chemical or electrical cardioversion after a month of anticoagulation. however, on telemetry, he was noted to have two five-beat runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia that were asymptomatic. he was taken to ep study. at ep study, the patient was noted to be quite agitated, requiring anesthesia to intubate the patient and a brief stay in the ccu. it was thought that the agitation was possibly secondary to the fentanyl that he received for anesthesia prior to the ep study. it may have been an adverse reaction, so the intubation was for airway protection. the plans for the ep study were for atrial flutter ablation as well as possible icd placement. however, given his agitation requiring five people to hold him down, the atrial flutter ablation was deferred and an icd was implanted. the patient was also started on amiodarone. on the day of discharge, the patient had been paced out of atrial flutter. he is to follow up with dr.

brain abscess: pt initialy given vancomycin/ceftriaxone/flagyl for broad coverage and on [**2119-5-31**], the pt unerwent burr hole and aspiration without complication. pt given dilantin and keppra for seizure prophylaxis initialy. brain abscess grew out strep anginosus. pt had thorough workup to investigate etiology: panorex of teeth, tte, tee and ct a+p. ct a+p showed cecal thickening and typhlitis, possibly the original source of infection, although pt denied every having gi symptoms. after patient's initial post-op course, he developed daily fevers up to 103 ultimately attributed to antibiotic drug reaction. see below for antibiotic course. after a trial of several antibiotics, it was felt that he had a beta-lactam allergy and he was ultimately switched to vancomycin and flagyl which he ultimately tolerated well. pt had repeat head imaging (head ct [**6-16**], head mri [**2119-6-18**]) which demonstrated enlargement of the abscess. the patient was then taken for a second i&d ([**2119-6-21**]), via mini craniotomy. the patient tolerated this procedure well, and returned to the medicine floor that day. post-operative neurologic exam was within normal limits. of note, abscess cultures were negative (including fungi and anaerobes). repeat imaging on [**6-27**] with mri suggested possible extension of the abscess again. the patient underwent third i&d on [**2119-6-28**]. no pus or abscess was found during this procedure (washings were negative) and his prior mri findings were likely attributed to post-op changes rather then progressing abscess infection. pt remained neurologically intact. #surgical interventions for abscess the pt underwent mutiple i&ds for s. anginosus brain abscess: [**2119-5-31**], [**2119-6-21**], [**2119-6-28**]. pt is due to get staples removed early [**2119-7-9**] (10 days since most recent i+d). # pharmacologic treatment of abscess/red man syndrome/b-lactam allergy: the pt was treated with numerous antimicrobial agents. treatment course was complicated by drug-induced rashes and fevers. pt was placed on empiric antibiotic therapy with vanc/ceftriaxone/flagyl until speciation was determined. pt was then switched to penicillin g. due to rash, penicillin was discontinued and he was then switched to ceftriaxone/flagyl. patient's rash worsened and he had daily high fevers 103, and he was then switched to meropenem. rash temporarily abated, but returned worse than before (morbilliform from head to toe, also with fevers). meropenem was discontinued and pt was placed on vancomycin/flagyl. during his initial vancomycin infusion ([**2119-6-16**]), pt developed characteristic 'red man syndrome' with cehst pain, pruritis, redness, agitation during the infusion. the patient was transferred to the micu for further observation and his vancomycin infusion rate was slowed down. he was initialy given solumedrol during his vanco infusions and that was then stopped as his clinical picture and rash improved. he was maintained on vancomycin (slow infusion over 3 hrs) and flagyl for the remainder of his hospital course and tolerated this well. the patient was discharged on vancomycin and flagyl, four week course from the date of third i&d ([**7-1**]- [**2119-7-26**]). pt will continued to get weekly cbc with diff, bun, cr, vanco trough, and close follow up with id and neurosurgery. # vancomycin infusion reaction: during patient's vancomycin infusion ([**2119-6-16**]), the patient became acutely agitated, tachypneic, and complained of worsened pruritus and sudden-onset chest pain with redness throughout body. the patient was diagnosed with ""red man syndrome."" the patient was transferred to the micu for supervision of further infusions. infusion rate was slowed (over 3hours). he was initialy ""pre-treated"" with diphenhydramine and methylprednisolone prior to vanco infusion, to further reduce rash and pruritus. methylprednisolone was eventually discontinued and patient tolerated vancomycin slow infusions without difficulty. # transaminitis: the patient had intermittently elevated lfts. transaminitis was likely due to drug reaction (phenytoin vs beta-lactams). ruq u/s and abdominal ct demonstrated no abnormalities, and bilirubins were normal. lfts trended down and stabalized while on vancomycin and flagyl. # eosinophilia: the patient had a eosinophilia, coincident with rash and transaminitis. eosinophilia was attributed to drug allergy. work up was negative for helminth infection, etc. # seizure prophylaxis: the pt had an apparent seizure after his first i&d. he was placed on phenytoin and levacetiram for seizure prophylaxis. due to concerns that phenytoin was contributing to his rash, fevers, and transaminitis, phenytoin was discontinued later in the hospital course. the patient was maintained on levacetiram throughout. he will follow up with neurosurgery to determine when he can stop this medication. # general infectious work-up: the patient underwent a thorough infectious work-up, including panorex xray, dental consult, tte, tee with bubble study, abdct, serial blood cultures, and assays. abdominal ct with contrast was notable for typhlitis and prominent mesenteric, periaortic, inguinal and femoral lymph nodes. testicular exam was normal. flow cytometry was negative for a lymphoma/leukemia. true etiology of his strep anginosus brain abscess was unclear.

[**known lastname 111991**], thank you for the privilege of participating in your care. you were admitted to the [**hospital1 69**] because you were found to have an infection in your brain (an ""abscess""). we still do not know where this infection came from. we do not know why you developed this infection in your brain. we performed a very thorough workup to investigate where this infection might have come from. a ct scan of your abdomen showed a possible inflammation or infection which might have been the original source of infection. the imaging of the teeth, chest, heart, rest of your body is all reassuring. the brain abscess required treatment with surgery and antibiotics. after your first surgery, imaging showed that the infection could be getting bigger. for this reason, you had to have two more surgeries. the most recent surgery was reassuring that the infection appears to be gone at this time. laboratory cultures from the first surgery showed infection with bacteria. cultures from the second and third operation did not grow any bacteria, indicating that the antibiotics were treating the infection well. also, the neurosurgeons did not see any infection during the third surgery. this is strong evidence that the infection is disappearing. during your hospitalization, you had a very itchy rash, and many high fevers. the rash and fevers were most likely caused by the antibiotics you took after your first surgery. these antibiotics that you seem to have an adverse reaction to are: penicillin, ceftriaxone and meropenem. you are currently on vancomycin and flagyl antibiotics that are fighting the infection. you are tolerating these medications well. you will need to continue the vancomycin and flagyl for a total 4 week course since your last surgery. thus, you should take it through [**7-26**]. the infectious disease doctors [**name5 (ptitle) **] [**name5 (ptitle) 111992**] [**name5 (ptitle) **] when to stop these medications. when you leave the hospital, it is very important that you continue to take all antibiotics as prescribed. if you do not take all your medicines, it is possible that the infection could come back. a nurse will come to your home to help you with the medications. it is also important to take the medication keppra, 1 pill twice a day. this medication will prevent seizures. you should continue this medication until the neurosurgeons tell you that you can stop. it will likely be for several months. please schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor, dr. [**last name (stitle) **]. also, please go to the appointments scheduled with the neurosurgery and infectious disease teams. it is very important that you go to these appointments. your doctors [**name5 (ptitle) 9004**] to be sure that you continue to recover well. you will also have more imaging of your head, to be sure that the infection is getting smaller. here are some instructions from the neurosurgery team: - your sutures should stay clean and dry until they are removed. - do not wash your head where the wound is until [**7-8**]. (10 days after surgery) at that point you can then wash your hair. ?????? have a friend or family member check the wound for signs of infection such as redness or drainage daily. ?????? exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting >10lbs, straining, or excessive bending. ?????? do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as motrin, aspirin, advil, or ibuprofen etc. until follow up. ?????? do not drive until your follow up appointment. followup instructions: follow-up appointment instructions ??????please call ([**telephone/fax (1) 4676**] to schedule an appointment with one of the physician assistant in [**7-18**] days from the time of surgery for staple removal ([**7-9**] you will be due to have the sutures removed). ??????you will need a ct of the brain with contrast in the future. you have an appointment scheduled on [**7-19**] per the neurosurgeons.

adults have been infected at sometime with ebv and will have measurable vca igg and ebna antibodies. antibodies to ebna develop 6-8 weeks after primary infection and remain present for life. presence of vca igm antibodies indicates recent primary infection. imaging: -renal us ([**2134-5-31**]): the right kidney measures 10.7 cm and the left 11 cm. there is no evidence of masses, hydronephrosis, abscess, or stones. the visualized bladder is unremarkable. the spleen is enlarged measuring 14.6 cm. impression: no evidence of renal abscess. splenomegaly. -ct abd/pelvis w/o contrast ([**2134-6-1**]): 1. cholelithiasis or biliary sludge within the gallbladder. further evaluation for cholecystitis is limited without intravenous contrast. if clinical concern for cholecystitis exists, a followup right upper quadrant ultrasound could be considered. 2. right adnexal hypodense lesion incompletely characterized on unenhanced ct. 3. hepatic steatosis. 4. enlarged spleen. -cxr ([**2134-6-1**]): lung volumes are low. borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. the presence of minimal fluid overload cannot be excluded. however, there is no overt pulmonary edema. no pleural effusions. -ruq us ([**2134-6-2**]): 1. normal examination of the gallbladder. no evidence for stones or sludge. no evidence for cholecystitis. 2. increased echogenicity of the liver consistent with fatty infiltration. please note that other forms of liver disease including significant fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this study. 3. splenomegaly of 15 cm. -pelvis us ([**2134-6-2**]): 1. two hemorrhagic cysts on the right ovary. 2. status post hysterectomy. brief hospital course: 50 year old woman with a history of t2dm and hypothyroidism admitted with fever, fatigue and myalgias, course complicated by hypotension, found to have acute cmv infection. # acute cytomegalovirus infection: her initial presentation with a fever, fatigue, diarrhea and diffuse myalgias was initially thought to be consistent with mononucleosis or a similar viral illness. supporting this was 8% atypical cells on her admission cbc/diff and splenomegaly to 15cm on imaging. at admission, monospot was negative and cmv igm was positive with a negative igg which is consistent with acute cmv infection. ebv igg was positive with negative igm suggesting prior exposure. she was treated conservatively with iv fluids and tylenol/nsaids for pain control and fevers. a renal us and ct abd/pelvis (without contrast because of prior adverse reaction to iv contrast) did not show any evidence of renal or preinephric abscess or other causes to explain her fevers. she had a ruq us because of concern for stones/sludge in the gallbladder on her ct abdomen. this us was unremarkable and did not show cholecyctitis or cbd dilation. she also had a pelvic us which was unremarkable aside from two ovarian cysts. she continued to have fevers up to 101.9f during this admission. at discharge, she was off iv fluids and taking adequate po. she has been instructed that cmv infection can take weeks to resolve and that she will likely continue to have these symptoms along with fevers during this time. we considered sending a hiv test, but this was deferred to her pcp given that her cmv infection is a better explaiantion for her symptoms and she has no high risk behaviors for hiv infection. this was communicated to her pcp by email prior to discharge. #hypotension: in the setting of high fevers and poor po intake, she was briefly hypotensive to the high 70 to low 80s systolic on her first night of admission. she was transferred to the micu for closer monitoring where she received iv fluids and did not require pressors. at discharge, she was taking good po and not requiring iv fluids with systolic bp in the 90-120s. #hypoxia: o2 sats briefly in the 88-92% range on room air while in the micu. she was asymptomatic and cxr was unremarkable. likely cause was atelectasis and she was given an incentive spirometer on the floor. she was quickly weaned to room air after transfer to the floor. #transaminitis: lfts mildly elevated this admission to the 40-50s, which is consistent with her acute cmv infection. ruq us was unremarkable with no cholecystitis, stones or cbd dilation. should have repeat lfts 4-6 weeks after discharge to ensure resolution. #uti: she had pansensitive e. coli at an outpatient visit prior to admission, no perinephric abscess or hydro on renal us or on ct abd/pelvis. prior to admission, she was on cipro which was subsequently changed to cefpodox and was continued on ctx for 3 days this admission. she had no urinary symptoms and urine culture was negative at admission. --inactive issues-- #t2dm: appears well controlled, last a1c in atrius records was 6.9% in [**2-/2134**] and has been <7 for the past 2 years. she was not on medications for her diabetes at admission and blood sugar remained well controlled. #hypothyroidism: continued on home dose of levothyroxine 100mcg daily #code status this admission: full (confirmed) #transitional issues: -should have an hiv test as an outpatient given her recent acute cmv infection -will need repeat lfts in [**4-2**] weeks to assess for resolution of her transaminitis -has been instructed to continue to consume plenty of fluids (including juice and sport drinks) while she is having diarrhea and high fevers. -has been advised that she may continue to have fatigue, myalgias and high fevers for a few weeks while her cmv infection resolves medications on admission:

[**last name (stitle) **] has been following her since [**2166**]), and stopping the medication that may have triggered the ha (amlodipine) and follow up with her pcp [**name9 (pre) 2678**] to try a different anti-hypertensive [**doctor last name 360**] because her bp was 170/x at that time (despite the amlodipine). also recommended giving reglan, which had worked at [**hospital1 **]. pt tells me now that the headache went away for a day or less after the reglan she got here last week, but returned, again present every day at the same intensity or worse, no full relief from the aforementioned analgesics. stopping the amlodipine did not seem to have any effect on the ha. she followed up with dr. [**last name (stitle) **] this past monday ([**10-3**]), and he recommended trying verapamil extended-release 120mg daily for the bp and headaches in lieu of the amlodipine. she checked with her cardiologist, who said this was ok, and has been taking it for a few days now, but no relief from the [**last name (lf) **], [**first name3 (lf) **] she returned to the ed. here, her bp has ranged from 190s-250s systolic over 70s to 110s diastolic, and did not respond well to labetalol or hydralazine. the ed staff planned to admit to medicine icu ([**hospital unit name 153**]) for blood pressure control, but dr. [**last name (stitle) **] noticed that she was in the ed and visited and recommended that we could admit to our neuro-icu service since we are familiar with the patient and he is attending on the inpatient service this week. on my interview with her, she gave the details as listed above and says that nothing else has changed since our last encounter except that she is frustrated that the headache won't stay away. her daughter is concerned about the situation and there is some disagreement between her and the patient about the desired amount of diagnosis and treatment -- patient requests dnr/dni and does not want, e.g., cta or potential coil/clipping if she were found to have an aneurysm. she also takes off the bp cuff and refuses bp cuff measurments because she says it hurts her arm. she says she will allow a-line placement and iv managment of her bp. ros: negative except as above and as noted in previous ed consult note from [**9-30**] (no changes). past medical history: 1. remote h/o migraine has 2. bilateral sdh/hygromas [**4-/2166**] s/p evacuation and resolution; no neurologic sequelae except intermittent vertex has since that time, including this week. 3. h/o dm2, but this was apparently related to hydrocortisone use for her low back pain; her daughter explained that the patient stopped requiring any diabetes medications since discontinuing the hydrocortisone (and also lost 10-20lbs recently). 4. obesity 5. hypertension on [**last name (un) **], bb, and recently started on ccb (the day before the headache started). 6. chronic anemia, on feso4 (not taking) and epo injections (taking). 7. depression, on ssri 8. hyperlipidemia, no longer taking statin (adverse reaction to atorvastatin) 9. h/o gout 10. h/o melanoma 11. h/o ""spastic colon"" on mesalamine 12. remote surgical history of gastrectomy, t&a, hysterectomy, ""bladder lift"" 13. hypothyroidism 14. low back pain, chronic - takes tramadol (""my favorite""), formerly experienced better relief with hydrocortisone. 15. chronic renal failure, which her daughter says was [**2-10**] adverse reaction to prilosec. recently discontinued from furosemide by nephrologist due to uremia (per dtr.). - denies any h/o stroke, tia, mi, cad social history: no tobacco, etoh family history: family history is notable for many relatives esp. women living into 90s or 100+ years old. physical exam: admission physical exam: vital signs: t 98.6f hr 86, reg bp 196/119 --> 180-190 / 74 on my exam rr 24 --> teens on my exam sao2 100% general: lying in ed stretcher in trauma bay, daughter sitting next to her. smiling, remembers me from last week. appears comfortable, in nad. heent: normocephalic and atraumatic. surgical pupils bilaterally. no scleral icterus. mucous membranes are moist. no lesions noted in oropharynx. neck: supple, with minimally restricted range of motion; no rigidity. no bruits. no lymphadenopathy. pulmonary: lungs cta. non-labored. cardiac: rrr, normal s1/s2, soft systolic murmur @usb. abdomen: obese. soft, non-tender, and non-distended. extremities: obese. warm and well-perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. 2+ radial, dp pulses bilaterally. c/o pain at both ue from bp cuff. ***************** neurologic examination: mental status exam: oriented to person, [**2168**], [**month (only) 359**], location, reason for treatment. some difficulty relating some historical details, as before; daughter fills in the rest. attentive, able [**doctor last name 1841**] forward and backward. speech was not dysarthric. repetition was intact. language is fluent with intact repetition and comprehension, normal prosody, and normal affect. there were no paraphasic errors. naming is intact to both high and low frequency objects (watch, band, pen, stethescope). anterograde memory excellent [**3-10**] --> [**3-10**] as before. no evidence of apraxia or neglect or ideomotor apraxia; the patient was able to reproduce and recognize brushing hair with right hand; used fingers/hand to represent toothbrush on brushing teeth with left hand. calculation intact (answers seven quarters in $1.75 and $0.32). left-right confusion as before; touched her left ear with her left hand instead of r ear with left hand. -cranial nerves: i: olfaction not tested. ii: surgical, non-reactive pupils bilaterally (old cataracts procedure). visual fields are full. disc sharp and vessels normal on the right; cannot visualize left fundus at this time. iii, iv, vi: eoms full and conjugate with no nystagmus. no saccadic intrusion during smooth pursuits. normal saccades. v: facial sensation intact and subjectively symmetric to light touch v1-v2-v3. vii: no ptosis, no flattening of either nasolabial fold. brow elevation is symmetric. eye closure is strong and symmetric. normal, symmetric facial elevation with smile. viii: hearing intact and subjectively equal to finger-rub bilaterally; worse hearing loss on left vs. extinguishes on left. ix, x: palate elevates symmetrically with phonation.

[**2100-2-5**], the st depressions were new. hospital course: 1. colitis: while in the micu, the patient had spiked a fever to 101.2 and had significant bandemia. she had an anion gap of 15 with a lactate of 4.1. she continued to note abdominal pain with diarrhea initially. was being treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl and received aggressive intravenous fluid hydration. clostridium difficile and stool cultures were sent and were all negative. it was unclear whether or not the patient had infectious colitis versus ischemic colitis with super infection from transmutation of flora. gastroenterology was consulted who could not provide a definitive diagnosis either. due to the patient's cardiac issues the patient was not sent for scope. over the course of several days, the patient's fever went down and her white count decreased. she was taken off the vancomycin and maintained on levofloxacin and flagyl. she will continue a 14 day course of these medications. she should have an outpatient colonoscopy performed by gastroenterology. no source of upper gi bleeding was noted. it is possible that this could have been from her lower gi sources. outpatient workup is indicated. she was tolerating a regular diet at the time of discharge. 2. atrial fibrillation: the patient's blood pressure medications were held on admission due to concern over gastrointestinal bleeding. on the day after admission the patient was noted to be atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. she was given lopressor iv push that resulted in a six second pause. given the patient's reported history to beta blockers and calcium channel blockers, electrophysiology was consulted, especially with the concern of av nodal disease. the patient was started on a verapamil drip. she was then changed to p.o. verapamil 80 mg p.o. t.i.d. the patient fluctuated between atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm with a well controlled rate. the verapamil was discontinued on hospital day three. the patient was transferred to the floor for additional workup of her gi issues. on the night she was sent to the floor the patient again had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response with a heart rate in the 150's to 170's with a blood pressure in the 70's systolic. she was brought back to the micu and placed on a verapamil drip with good control of her blood pressure. she was then changed to verapamil 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. with good control of her ventricular response. she went back and forth between atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm. decision was made not to anticoagulate given her gastrointestinal issues and recent gi bleed. electrophysiology continued to consult and directed that if her rate was not well controlled with the p.o. verapamil that additional nodal blockade with amiodarone or other agents may be necessary and might require a pacemaker. they were not willing to do this procedure at this time due to her stable condition and gi issues. 3. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: this patient was maintained on her albuterol, atrovent and flovent inhalers. she did not experience any copd exacerbations. she was maintained on her home oxygen requirement and was discharged on one liter of home oxygen. 4. hypertension: the patient has likely poorly controlled hypertension as an outpatient. she had her antihypertensives held and then restarted. the patient was on cozaar as an outpatient and was placed on captopril as an inpatient. she did not have any adverse reactions to this medication. she was maintained on low dose to keep her blood pressure systolic greater than 120 give a question of ischemic colitis. she was discharged on verapamil and lisinopril. 5. bipolar disorder: the patient was initially seen with depakote 500 mg p.o. q. hs. and seroquel 200 mg p.o. q. hs. the patient was seen to be very somnolent during her admission in the micu on this dose of seroquel. the dose was decreased to 100 mg p.o. q. hs. and the patient was more alert. she will be discharged on this dose with follow up with her psychiatrist. condition at discharge: stable. discharge status: patient will be discharged to rehabilitation. she will follow up with psychiatry, gastroenterology and cardiology. discharge diagnoses: 1. colitis, ischemic versus infectious. 2. atrial fibrillation complicated by rapid ventricular response and hypotension. 3. lower gastrointestinal bleed. 4. upper gastrointestinal bleed. 5. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen. 6. bipolar disorder. discharge

[**known lastname **] is a fairly active 82-year-old woman who presented with a history of chest pain. she was evaluated and ruled out for a myocardial infarction. her workup included radiographs that demonstrated a mass in the left upper lobe and was confirmed by computed tomography scan. the risk, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with her at length. we felt that this was most likely a lung cancer of some type, and she might benefit from resection even given her advanced age. she had some concerns about this, and was discussed them for quite some time. she also has a history of some atypical visual changes; possibly transient ischemic attacks, and a history of polycythemia [**doctor first name **]. she underwent a preoperative evaluation including attempted snipping of her carotid artery by dr. [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**name (stitle) 1132**] here. eventually, she was felt not to be a safe candidate during the angiogram. she was placed on aspirin and plavix at that time. after this procedure, her lung mass was again addressed with her. she consented to undergo definitive treatment. past medical history: her previous medical history as above. medications on admission: her medications preoperatively were plavix, aspirin, hydrea, levoxyl, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol. physical examination on presentation: her physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. hospital course: please note that this dictation is being performed several months after the patient's date of death. it was difficult to determine who the responsible resident was for dictating this discharge summary, and i am going to complete it at this time. my recollection at this time is being reinforced by the patient's chart; although, for the exact details i would refer to the medical record. the patient underwent the above-mentioned procedure on [**2184-9-13**]. postoperatively, she was monitored in the intensive care unit. for the first two postoperative days, she was monitored in the postanesthesia care unit for some (1) respiratory lability and (2) relative hypotension requiring [**name (ni) 103585**] drip at low-to-moderate doses to maintain her blood pressure. we were especially aggressive about this given her previous history of atypical transient ischemic attacks. on or about the third postoperative day, the patient manifested signs of respiratory distress. a chest x-ray demonstrated collapse of the remaining left lower lobe, and the patient was intubated. the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery recovery unit, and full monitoring was performed. over approximately the subsequent second to nine days, the patient showed steady slow improvement. she did not show any evidence of multiorgan failure, and her pulmonary symptoms slowly resolved. she was bronchoscoped on a daily basis with the finding of thick secretions as well as mucosal edema. interventional pulmonology was consulted at this time, and they performed the majority of the bronchoscopies. she treated with prophylactic antibiotics, and several cultures did not prove her to have a pneumonia. she was slowly weaned from ventilatory support by approximately postoperative day nine, and she was extubated. at this point, we re-evaluated her swallowing given the prolonged intubation and previous surgery, and thought this would be prudent. her swallowing evaluation showed gross aspiration. she was made nothing by mouth and treated with nutrition alternatives. around postoperative day twelve, she still manifested an increased white blood cell count despite being afebrile. she was treated with prophylactic antibiotics. however, increasingly over the next one to two weeks, this was felt actually to be related to withdrawal of her hydrea medication for polycythemia [**doctor first name **]. we had a long discussion with her hematologist about this, and this was felt eventually to be the most likely cause of her leukocytosis. clinically, she did not appear infected nor septic. her pulmonary status, however, continued to be tenuous requiring aggressive pulmonary toilet. because of intermittent left lower lobe collapse and effusion on that side, interventional radiology was consulted and placed a small drain in the left pleural space on postoperative day fourteen for effusion. the culture did not grow out any bacteria on final analysis. around this time, ear/nose/throat was consulted for her swallowing difficulties, and she was found to have bilateral vocal cord paresis. they felt that this would improve with time and simply keeping her nothing by mouth would suffice. over the subsequent two weeks, the patient showed gradual improvement; although, she was not yet able to swallow. at the end of [**month (only) 359**] (around [**9-30**]), gastroenterology was consulted for placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. it was around this time she also had manifest signs of increasing blood pressure lability. she had an acute decompensation around [**10-1**] or [**10-2**], and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was deferred for a later date. cardiology was involved in her management, and pressors were needed to support her blood pressure. the patient had an elevation in her troponin to a level of 18, and an echocardiogram which showed severe global dysfunction of her left ventricle. this was a significant change from her preoperative which essentially showed a normal ventricle. she also had some arrhythmias at this time with some ventricular as well as atrial arrhythmias. a cardiac catheterization was performed at that time which surprisingly showed completely normal coronary arteries. it was unclear as to the etiology of her acute decompensation in cardiac function, and this may have been related to some adverse reaction to a drug (which eventually remained undetermined). by [**10-6**], the patient was showing steady progress. her repeat echocardiogram actually showed a normal left ventricle. she was re-evaluation at this time by ear/nose/throat and felt to still be at high risk and was kept nothing by mouth at this time. again, at this time, the patient had no signs of sepsis or infection. on or about [**10-9**], the patient had an episode of monocular blindness and was consulted by the neurology service. she had previously had a workup for this; both as an inpatient earlier in her hospital stay and as mentioned preoperatively (including an aborted attempt at stenting her carotid). at this time, the treatment recommended was maintaining her blood pressure at a higher rate; and this was done with a dopamine infusion. neurologically, she was otherwise fairly nonfocal and was gaining strength each day. by [**10-13**], the patient was showing improvement with physical therapy, and speech and swallow evaluation showed significant improvement and no evidence of aspiration, and she was placed on a diet with aspiration maneuvers as described by the speech therapy department. it should be mentioned that the patient had an increasing interstitial pattern on her chest x-rays. it was unclear as to the etiology of this. the differential included infection versus inflammatory connective tissue versus lymphatic spread of tumor. her pathology showed bronchoalveolar carcinoma well differentiated as well as a noninvasive thymoma. therefore, we felt that neoplasm was probably unlikely. she was eventually started on prophylactic antibiotics, but on [**10-14**] the patient had an acute decompensation of an extremely severe nature. the patient showed evidence of respiratory distress and was intubated immediately by anesthesia. her hemodynamics became progressively/rapidly decompensated, and fluids and pressors were necessary for support. immediately, invasive hemodynamic monitoring lines were placed including a swan-ganz catheter that was consistent with septic physiology. aggressive treatment was performed at this time to optimize her cardiac, respiratory, pulmonary, and renal function. we had a long discussion with her family at this time as to the events that occurred, and sought their opinion as to what she would prefer for her management. we agreed that aggressive management would continue to see if she showed dramatic improvement. if not, we would consider alternative strategies. over the subsequent two day, the patient showed absolutely no improvement with progression to multiorgan dysfunction. after a long discussion with the patient's family (including her son who was her health care proxy), they felt that the patient would not want to persist with this mode of life support given her age and extremely poor prognosis. at this time, withdrawal of support was initiated and comfort measures made, and the patient expired. the family was present during this time. dr. [**last name (stitle) 175**] was present and participated throughout all the decision making processes. discharge disposition: death.

there were no malignant cells found in either of the fluids and the pericardial window biopsy was negative. also, rheumatology evaluated her and thought it was not secondary to a rheumatological cause because her admission [**doctor first name **] on [**7-6**] was negative (however, she had positive [**doctor first name **] on [**2177-7-25**] times two). her pulmonary status improved and the effusions remained stable so she was discharged to vent-core on [**2177-8-1**]. she did well at the rehabilitation and her course there was actually unknown to us at this point, however, we do know that she was unable to be weaned off of her ventilator. she was currently on cmv with a total volume of 500, respiratory rate of 12 and an fio2 of 40% and had recently failed a ps trial secondary to tachypnea and low volume. recent events at the rehabilitation are summarized below: we know that she recently finished a course of vancomycin and cefepime on [**11-17**], which was begun empirically secondary to a fever. at this time, we do not know the length of time she was on either of these antibiotics. she was recently restarted on lisinopril on approximately [**11-16**]. she does have a history of her creatinine going up on ace inhibitors in the past, however, she was having blood pressures up to the 240s and an attempt was made to restart her on lisinopril which she had not been on since [**month (only) 216**]. her creatinine upon discharge from [**hospital1 190**] ranged from 1.0 to 1.5. she briefly had some elevations of the creatinine into the 2.4 range secondary to acute renal failure from intravenous contrast. they restarted the lisinopril at 10, went up to 20, and discontinued her lisinopril on [**11-20**], as her creatinine had started to rise. it was 3.2 on [**11-21**] and then increased to 3.6 at the outside hospital on [**11-24**]. renal did evaluate her while she was at the rehabilitation and they suggested dialysis as well as an increase in her lasix. she did not undergo dialysis at that time. then, on [**11-21**], a rash was noted to have started that was initially limited and mild but then she underwent desquamation of her skin associated with diffuse erythema and edema. she was also noted to have an eosinophilia since [**2177-10-17**]. we know that her serum eosinophils were 16% on [**11-19**] and had decreased to 12% on [**11-24**]. of note, she had also been on prednisone for an unknown reason. at the rehabilitation it was decided to start weaning this down from 10 mg to 5 mg one week ago. according to the physicians that took care of her at the rehabilitation, her only new medications were lisinopril from approximately [**11-16**] until [**11-20**]. she had been previously on that but not since [**month (only) 216**]. she was also recently started on amlodipine however, it was related that this was started on [**11-22**], after the rash had appeared. all her other hypertensive medications she had been on for quite some time, and the only other recent medications were her antibiotics, vancomycin and cefepime, that were discontinued on [**11-17**], when the course was finished. review of systems: the patient can nod her head with responses and denied pain and shortness of breath at time of admission. past medical history: 1. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: restrictive lung disease with reactive airway disease. 2. status post tracheostomy on [**7-17**] and peg placement on [**2177-7-28**]. her tube feeds are at a goal of 35 cc per hour. she has been unable to be weaned off her ventilator at vent-core. 3. pericardial effusion / tamponade that was found to be exudative with negative cytologies. status post window placement on [**2177-7-9**]. 4. bilateral pleural effusions, transudative, status post left pleurodesis on [**2177-7-9**]. 5. breast cancer (dcif), status post total mastectomy, er-pos, stage 2, no radiation, n0 m0, and currently off tamoxifen. 6. severe hypertension, on five medications. 7. type 2 diabetes mellitus, previously on oral hypoglycemics and now requiring insulin. 8. chronic renal insufficiency secondary to diabetes mellitus with nephrotic range proteinuria. 9. acute renal failure secondary to intravenous dye in [**2177-7-10**]. also had a history of elevated creatinine secondary to ace inhibitors. 10. thalassemia trait. 11. questionable history of osteogenesis imperfecta. 12. legal blindness; she has a left eye prosthesis as well. 13. urinary incontinence. 14. echocardiogram results from [**2177-6-9**] revealed a right ventricular wall clot/tumor with an ejection fraction of 58%. her latest echocardiogram at [**hospital1 188**] on [**2177-7-22**], revealed an ejection fraction of greater than 65%, mild lae, mild symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regular wall motion; mild thickened atrial valve and mitral valve leaflets; moderate pulmonary hypertension; small to moderate pericardial effusion predominantly over the right ventricle. no change when compared to the prior study of [**2177-7-17**]. 15. noted to have vancomycin resistant enterococcus in her urine on [**7-23**]. 16. left ocular paresthesia. 17. anemia;

there are no mucosal lesions. mucous membranes were moist. neck: tracheostomy is in place. neck is supple. cardiovascular: regular rate and rhythm, normal s1 and s2. respirations: decreased breath sounds at bases. occasional wheeze heard in the left anterior aspect of the well healed abdomen. normoactive bowel sounds. peg is in place. soft, nontender, nondistended. extremities with plus two pitting edema diffusely with no cyanosis or clubbing. extremities are warm; plus two dorsalis pedis is felt on the left, however, could not detect distal pulses on the right extremity. skin: as described by the dermatologic consultation later in the evening; generalized moderate non-colorous erythema with marked desquamation and areas that show evidence of good re-epithelialization. multiple eroded areas in the intertrigous areas of the neck, axillae, breasts and groin. approximately 30% of her back showed superficial erosions and skin sloughing. positive perianal punched out ulcers. also of note, the conjunctivae appears slightly erythematous but on gross examination there were no conjunctival or corneal erosions. neurologic: moves all four extremities. pertinent laboratory: from vent-core on [**11-19**], white blood cell count 24, hematocrit 29.2, platelets 329, mcv of 65 with a differential of 72% polys, 5% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, 16% eosinophils and 1% basophil. from vent-core on [**11-24**], revealed a sodium of 134, potassium of 4.4, chloride of 103, bicarbonate of 22, bun of 130, a creatinine of 3.6 (was 2.4 on [**11-21**] and 3.2 on [**11-19**]). glucose of 111, calcium of 8.6. reportedly had a serum eosinophil percentage of 12. upon admission to [**hospital1 69**], white blood cell count 13.2, hematocrit of 30.1 with an mcv of 66, platelets of 315, pt of 14.4, inr of 1.4, ptt of 28.3. sodium of 135, potassium of 4.9, chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 20, bun of 135, creatinine of 3.6, glucose of 201, calcium of 9.0 corrected to 10.1, phosphorus of 3.4, magnesium of 2.5. alt of 14, ast 22, ld of 233, alkaline phosphatase of 166 which is mildly elevated. total bilirubin of 0.5, albumin of 2,6, lipase of 14, amylase of 20. studies were: 1) portable chest x-ray revealed fairly marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. predominantly left ventricle. pulmonary [**hospital1 56207**] are predominant in the upper zones and some left ventricular failure cannot be excluded. loss of translucency at both lung bases; left diaphragm is elevated. tracheostomy is in satisfactory position. probably bilateral pleural effusions with the question of a left lower lobe infiltrate/atelectasis. 2) renal artery ultrasound from [**2177-6-9**] at [**hospital1 346**] was notable to have a right kidney size of 9.4 and a left kidney size of 9.3. the doppler's were unable to be done. 3) renal artery ultrasound done on [**2177-11-26**], revealed no hydronephrosis, patency of the [**last name (lf) 56207**], [**first name3 (lf) **] the doppler's were not done. the right kidney size was 9.6. the left kidney was unable to be estimated for size due to positional factors, however, it looks grossly normal. hospital course: mrs. [**known lastname 5261**] was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. a dermatology consultation was obtained on the evening of the 17th. their assessment that this was represented likely resolving [**doctor last name **]-[**location (un) **] syndrome versus ten and it seems that it is most consistent with ten. she does show significant re-epithelialization. there is no calor, no tenderness, no bullae evident on examination. her eosinophils have dropped from 16% to 12 in the last few days which suggests improvement in her drug hypersensitivity. these and the fact that her prior antibiotics have now been discontinued, suggests that she is resolving from a prior ten. the most likely culprit for this adverse reaction includes lisinopril which was discontinued on [**11-20**], secondary to the development of acute renal failure. other culprits include vancomycin and the cefepime that had been on board since [**8-1**] and were discontinued on [**11-17**]. cefepime was more likely than vancomycin to cause this adverse drug reaction. these antibiotics should be avoided as well as all ace inhibitors. the amlodipine was also recently added after her rash had begun and at this point until we get the actual medical sheets from the rehabilitation facility, we are holding this amlodipine as well. i have spoken to [**hospital3 105**] vent-core unit, [**location (un) 1773**], where the phone number is [**telephone/fax (1) 26091**], and a nurse there was going to fax the start and stop dates of all the medications she was on during her admission there. we have yet to receive that fax. they also recommended checking urine eosinophils which are currently pending, serum eosinophils which did return on her admission as only 3%, however, the morning of transfer have increased to 7%. liver function tests which were normal except for a slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase as well as ggt of 68 and a bun and creatinine that were at 136 and 3.6 on the morning of [**11-26**]. it was also recommended to follow her electrolytes twice a day. her full electrolytes panel the day of transfer was a sodium of 137, potassium 4.7, chloride 103, bicarbonate of 20, bun of 136, creatinine of 3.6, glucose of 208, calcium of 8.6, phosphorus of 3.2, magnesium of 2.4. of note, she also had a white blood cell count of 13.1, hematocrit of 31.3, platelets of 324, with a differential of 78% neutrophils, 1% bands, 7% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, 7% eosinophils and 1% metas. for her skin we were placing xeroderm patches as well as using bactroban instead of bacitracin to her wounds. the next morning, dermatology obtained two 5 mm skin punch biopsies at the left parasternal line under sterile conditions and were sent to pathology for a diagnosis. an epidermal jelly-roll from epidermis adjacent to fresh erosion also sent in, however, on dermatology fellow's examination, there were no bullae, only erosions. the biopsy sites were sutured with #5 ethilon, two sutures were used at each site. these sutures will need to be removed in approximately two weeks. the above procedure was done by [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**last name (namepattern1) 103104**], pager number [**serial number 103105**] [**hospital1 756**]. they also recommended swabbing the neck erosions for cultures which look slightly purulent. other entities on differential diagnoses include staphylococcus skin syndrome, which is possible but probably not likely in this case. we did sent pan-cultures for urine, sputum and blood. we also started her on normal saline fluids at a rate of only 60 cc per hour for now. we were concerned that she might have had some congestive heart failure on her chest x-ray. also, she had a very small intravenous line that was in her finger and we were worried about losing access overnight. her intakes and outputs over an eight hour period overnight was 925 cc in with a urine output of 305 cc per hour. her other work-up for the rash revealed an esr of 20 which is high normal, a tsh and [**doctor first name **] which are pending, and a rheumatoid factor which returned as negative. 2. infectious disease: she was placed on precautions upon admission here for a history of vre in the urine, which was treated with linezolid in [**2177-6-9**]. also with a history of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus. all antibiotics were held at this point and her white blood cell count, though, was slightly elevated (she is on prednisone), which was basically normal and she was afebrile. dermatology also suggested getting viral cultures of the punched out lesions of the peri-rectal area that they saw. other infectious disease issues were that the sputum culture gram stain had returned with greater than 25 polys, less than 10 epithelials, however, four plus gram negative rods. her secretions were slightly yellow and thick but as she was afebrile and was in the setting of an acute rash, session: did not start antibiotics. her blood cultures from [**11-25**] were no growth to date so far. 3. renal: the patient is in acute renal failure; likely multi-factorial including recent ace inhibitor, pre-renal causes secondary to a recent increased dose of her lasix, like maybe congestive heart failure, poor oncotic pressure secondary to low albumin and nephrotic range proteinuria. likely ain, especially given increased peripheral eosinophils as well as rash. we decided to send her urine for electrolytes as well as urine for urine urea to check an fe urea. these are pending at the time of this dictation. urine eos were sent. we obtained a renal ultrasound and the results are listed above. she was put in for a cardiac echocardiogram and we decided to rule out myocardial infarction in case myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure had occurred in this case. 4. hypertension: the patient was continued on hydralazine 100 four times a day; clonidine 0.3 three times a day; metoprolol 100 four times a day, labetalol 200 q. six hours; isosorbide 40 three times a day, but the amlodipine was held. her blood pressure had ranged from 143 to 174 systolic overnight. it was decided to initiate a work-up for the secondary causes of her hypertension. it appears that since her kidneys are both of normal size, even though dopplers were unable to be done, that the likelihood of renal artery stenosis was maybe low, however, the test is not definitive. at this time, we are avoiding all ace inhibitors. 5. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: we are continuing albuterol and atrovent mdi. 6. for diabetes mellitus type 2, we initiated four times a day fingersticks with a regular insulin sliding scale as well as continue her nph insulin at 20 units q. a.m. and 20 units q. p.m. 7. for her anemia with her a very low mcv which is likely secondary to her history of thalassemia trait. a type and screen was sent and her epogen was continued. 8. gastrointestinal: she was continued on colace and p.r.n. bisacodyl. her tube feeds were started. stools were guaiac, however, she had not had a stool. a ggt was checked because of her elevated alkaline phosphatase and this was also found to be elevated at a level of 68. 9. history of pericardial effusion status post window. this is another reason that we wanted to check a transthoracic echocardiogram. she had cardiomegaly on chest x-ray, however, there is no evidence of tamponade on her ekg. 10. fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: most of this was already discussed in the renal section. she was gently hydrated with normal saline 60 cc per hour overnight. the bun and creatinine appear to have maybe remained stable now. she had hypoalbuminemia and nutrition was consulted. we are continuing her calcium carbonate. we are also continuing free water boluses 125 cc per hour q. eight hours per the g-tube. however, if her sodium continues to decrease, then these can be stopped. her electrolytes probably need to be followed twice a day. 11. ventilator: she is currently on assist control 500 x 12, 5 of peep/40% saturation and is saturating well. there is no current reason to change her ventilation settings at this time. 12. prophylaxis: she is on subcutaneous heparin and protonix. 13. tubes, lines and drains: she arrived to the floor with one very small peripheral intravenous in her left finger. a consultation in the a.m. was put in for a stat picc line. the interventional team had assessed her at the bedside and at the time of this dictation, it appears that she will not be undergoing picc placement, but rather will attempt to place some sort of central line. it is unknown exactly how we are going to obtain this access at the point of this dictation. a foley catheter is in place. 14. full code. condition at discharge: fair. discharge status: it was recommended by dermatology that she would benefit from transfer to a burn unit. at this time, she has been accepted to go to the [**hospital6 **] burn unit. of note, it was decided not to start her on intravenous igg at this point. discharge medications: 1. amlodipine 10 mg q. day p.o., recently began on [**11-22**], after the rash had appeared, but has been held today. 2. hydralazine 100 mg four times a day; she has been on this medication for a while. please note that the vent-core sheets report that she began this medicine on [**11-21**], however, this was only a renewal according to dr. [**last name (stitle) **]. 3. lasix 40 mg twice a day. 4. nph 20 units twice a day. 5. h2o 125 cc three times a day. 6. benadryl 25 mg q. eight hours. 7. subcutaneous heparin 5000 twice a day. 8. prednisone 5 mg q. day. 9. protein soy supplement, two scoops in the feeding tube q. eight hours. 10. nepro 3/4 strength tube feeds 35 cc per hour. 11. clonidine 0.3 three times a day. 12. bisacodyl 10 mg q. day p.r.n. 13. regular insulin sliding scale with humulin. 14. lopressor 100 mg four times a day. 15. labetalol 200 mg four times a day. 16. isosorbide dinitrate 40 mg q. eight hours. 17. sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n. 18. protonix 40 q. day. 19. epogen 40,000 units subcutaneously weekly. 20. brimonidine 0.2% solution, one drop bilaterally q. eight hours. 21. eiazdolamide one drop solution to each eye three times a day. 22. ativan 1 mg q. eight hours. 23. calcium carbonate 500 mg q. eight hours. 24. ipratropium and albuterol mdi four puffs q. four hours p.r.n. discharge diagnoses: 1. acute renal failure. 2. rash most consistent with toxic epidermal necrolysis (ten). 3. severe hypertension on several anti-hypertensive. 4. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 5. status post tracheostomy [**7-17**] and peg [**7-28**]. 6. status post pericardial effusion with window placement on [**7-9**]. 7. history of bilateral pleural effusion. 8. history of breast cancer as above. 9. type 2 diabetes mellitus.

[**known lastname 11794**] is a [**age over 90 52**]yo woman with h/o cad s/p bms to lcx, systolic heart failure with ef of 40%, and chronic kidney disease who initially presented [**4-29**] with chest pain and is currently being transferred to the ccu for shortness of breath and hypoxia. briefly, ms. [**known lastname 11794**] was recently admitted to the [**hospital unit name 44**] [**date range (1) 11991**], where she was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure due to heart failure. she was discharged to [**hospital 12**] rehab, where she was reportedly doing well until she developed chest pain associated with nausea and backache. per prior notes, these symptoms were reminscent of how she felt when she had acute coronary syndrome in the past. she was admitted to the cardiology service and ruled out for an mi. when her bnp was found to be > 45,000 (value was 32,000 during [**hospital unit name 44**] stay), the team entertained the possibility that chf exacerbation might be an explanation of her symptoms, though cxr only showed cardiomegaly but no vascular congestion. her bp meds were titrated up and she was given iv lasix for diuresis. between [**date range (1) 11992**], she received escalating doses of iv lasix +/- metolazone for episodes of shortness of breath. in addition, her hydralazine and imdur doses were increased. interestingly, she never desaturated during this time and her cxrs were not read as being consistent with pulmonary edema. during this time, her cr increased from 2.9 to 3.6. she was briefly on a lasix gtt during [**5-3**], but this was stopped in the setting of poor urine output and a cr of 3.8. over the subsequent two days, all diuretics were stopped. today, she was complaining of chest pain and upper back pain. in addition, she began feeling increasingly short of breath and was noted to be tachypneic into the 20s. she triggered for nursing concern. an abg on 2l of nasal cannula showed: 7.48/46/62 and a cxr showed findings consistent with pulmonary edema as well as b/l lower lobe opacities. she received lasix 120mg iv and nitropaste. two hours later, her next nurse was called into the room to evaluate chest pain. the patient was noted be hypoxic to 89% on 3.5l and be newly disoriented, causing a second trigger for nursing concern. she was placed on a non-rebreather with improvement in her sat's to 100%. per discussion with the cardiology attending, the patient was transferred to the ccu for further care. upon arrival to the ccu, the patient was sleepy but rousable. she endorsed substernal chest pain and pain in her upper back. at one point she stated she ""could not catch"" her breath, though later she denied feeling short of breath. on review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, tia, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. she denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. she denies exertional buttock or calf pain. all of the other review of systems were negative. cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. allergies: atorvastatin muscle/bone pai tylenol (oral) (dm hb/pseudoephed/acetamin/cp) muscle pain;

239,"clinician: resident i was asked by mr. [**known lastname 4736**]' nurse to clarify his acetylcysteine dosing. based on a sheet handed to me by hepatology, i ordered 10,000 mg per hour of acetylcysteine. pharmacy sent up a total of 3 bags of acetylcysteine that were dosed in the following way: he continued on an infusion of nac on which he had been started at [**hospital1 609**] until 7 pm when our medication was ready. the infusion was running at 63 cc/hr w/ unknown concentration. bag 1) started at approximately 7 pm and contained 10,000 mg in 500 cc ns. this was run at 63 cc/hr. bag 2) started at 2 am contained 10,000 mg in 500 cc ns. this was run at 63 cc/hr and ended at 12:30 pm. bag 3 was sent up but never given. it contained 10,000 mg in 250 cc ns. thus, instead of receiving the usual dosing of 20,000 mg in 32 hours, he received 20,000 mg in 17-20 hours. pharmacy was called and helped to clarify the actual dosing. the toxicology team was called to determine if this could have any potential adverse reactions for the patient. they said that the most common reaction to acetylcysteine is an aniphylactoid reaction that usually happens in the first several minutes. they believe that the likelihood of adverse reaction is very low. they have called poison control to confirm this and the recommendation is that we continue to monitor him carefully. in fact, there are some high-dose protocols that approximate this dosing scheme. dr.

however, he has had runs of nsvt since admission to the ccu, last run [**6-25**] at 2300 less than 10 beats. this is most likely a reperfusing rhythm. patient remains asymptomatic. continues to have sinus rhythm with pvcs. - continue to monitor on tele. . # anticoagulation: patient with apical hypokinesis and at risk for blood pooling and clot formation. since patient has had akinesis recorded on echo in [**2158**], will not anticoagulate at this time as patient is at lower risk in the chronic state. - hold for now - guaiac stools next bowel movement #dm2: the patient has a history of dm2, for which he takes glargine (65u), metformin, glyburide, and 70/30 insulin at home. - hold metformin and glyburide in the setting of recent contrast administration (fsbs in the low 100s) - monitor blood sugar today and consider giving glargine this evening as patient may need basal coverage. - fsbg and hiss - encourage po intake . #. acute on cki: the patient presented with cr of 1.6, with baseline of 1.3. likely pre-renal etiology (poor forward flow with low ci); based on bun/cr ratio >20/1 and feun = 28.15%; also with a history of intrinsic chronic renal disease as patient has long standing diabetes and hypertension. - continue to monitor cr and uop with diuresis. - continue lasix gtt as patient is fluid overloaded and # social issues: vna at a minimum, to assess home safety and adherence to treatment, if not rehab. . icu care nutrition: comments: cardiac diet glycemic control: comments: hiss, glargine per home dose lines: 20 gauge - [**2167-6-24**] 05:39 pm prophylaxis: dvt: sub q heparin stress ulcer: ppi, gi cocktail vap: head of bed > 30 degrees comments: oob as tolerated communication: icu consent signed comments: code status: full code disposition: icu",1
